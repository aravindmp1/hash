 Dere was a long que . Que management systems were no functioning, every single request of customers were taking long to be processed, the executive s were hlpful
 No fan, no A/c working
 Simply awesome . But i dont like to go to store . U know every one has a busy work . Customer care is there but why u tell us that u must go to store
 Without making delay store bill collector attending my issue her name Shwetha she is very good executive in mandya branch .
 Customers Service person behavior was really very bad . He doesn't know how to talk to customers .
 Every vodafone 2G internet speed should be 100 kbps . Pls enhance my 2G internet speed uptoc100 kbps
 Waiting period is longer else all fine
 My query got resolved in a perfect way and I didn't had to wait too long for it
 Everything was well organised.and executive were promt in helping desicion making
 I told your representative to activate 899 red plan but he activated 499 red plan please change my plan than I will be happy with ur service
 The reason behind my such good ratings is that u guys were really friendly and helpful and at the same time u came up with the best solution for me
 Intelligend
 Excellent service .....very fast
 The person was very helpful and polite
 Very help good job
 Excellant worklmg
 Good
 I had to visit your store for 3 times in a day for a problem . The staff was engaged in their personal work rather then helping the customers . They werebusy filling firms which they could have done afterwards .
 Stop deactivating the sims when they are in use.it makes the customer feel bad on your network. .
 I am 7 to 8 year customer but no value for me
 I m very satisfied to your vodafone store...all is well. . And nothing any...... ?
 This is very good service of Vodafone . & there were no such good service in other sims Thank you
 t. The rating is for this visit only .
 There is no response to the customer . Very poor service. .
 Its too muchh costly.. . As soon as possible i m going to change my connection
 The way of interacting and solving issue is very politely and not wastege of time in waiting . Overall very good service provide by all
 My issue was handled courteously, it was resolved fast .
 I have activated 3G service on my number but Internet is not working at all .
 Very nice n very good experience . Whatever my requirements they had fulfilled but the plan available at store lavel isn't enough when compare to sales executive's plans .
 The wait time was very long and the store associate was nice but not particularly helpful . Overall it was not bad .
 mujhe ni pta mera num se balance ku kata gya h bs mujhe itna pta h mujhe wo wapis chiya
 information . But he was very polite .
 Very good service from hari. .
 No comments in specific . She did farely well .
 Information had been given by store was totally wrong
 They have helped us nicely . No waiting .
 It was better and good than other network outlets.. . Keep rock n _XX/m/ _XX/m/
 LG good
 Provide more better service
 They served very well
 You guys are doing great . Just initiate the customer service across circles . My SIM got damaged while I was in Bihar . I had to wait to come to Chennai for receiving new sim .
 Over all it was good, but it took 10 min for wating
 Store services are very good but Vodafone technical services are upto mark 3 or 4
 When my number came . One of your care executive told me to wait for a long time and he was busy doing some other work . Then a lady executive helped me out .
 My new 3G Internet plan is not activated yet
 re we figured out the nano SIM was not placed in phone even . We had to make the trip back to store and got it fixed which was an hassle . After that stilld moving little in organized fashion . After the phone SIM card and payment was made our will get activated in 20 minutes, was not happened until late wheWe had to repeat the same question 4 times and then eventually we had to ask for manager where still we waited another 15 minutes . Then the things starte
 Its vry gud to intact wd vodfon store
 The lajpat nagar store is so stubborn they didnt help me,
 Good
 Smart service of the executive I like it
 nd tl...on the floor anytime . .. .
 I have waited more then 25 mins but everybody is playing in your store
 Irresponsible attitude towards addressing customer's grievances
 Employees are doing a good job given the pressure of volumes it is the management which is not doing enough such as adding more people to attend to customers . My phone was activated after payment was made but it got deactivated because the payment did not get posted due to excessive work per employees I suffered a lot of tension and loss of my productivity.i regret porting back to Vodafone.if your volumes have increased due to closure of Loop you must invest in all areas to keep us happy or you will loose us
 I got prompt service, my doubts are clearly explained and sorted out .
 Overall services are good . If we change our plan please confirm through sms .
 Over all is good but for postpiad customers Ur not giving good offer its so costly
 Store opens extremely late almost 11 a m . The work finished very fast . Very efficient staff .
 Helpline and customercare are very fast n helpful
 Call rates are higher than other your competitive, otherwise all things satisfied to us as your store
 The person is having full information of all plans and other services
 Vodafone is cheating on me Vodafone is very bad I will never suggest to any one take Vodafone postpaid connection u guys are helpless don't know anythingu just know how to waste customers time I did very big mistake to take Vodafone postpaid connection... . Very dissatisfied with service.. . I will go consumer court to report that issue regarding cheating
 Pls check my email that I sent to Vodafone care .mum@vodafone.com
 I am happy talk with mr rajeev
 Your representstive was efficient, supportive, confident & gave us total confidence in your product
 I m fully satisfied with service
 Very poor network.no customer care .customer care calls - rituals & distubing,not resposive to complaints, payment reminders even to regular payers & so on
 Because ur money for net n for balance is nice n r in budget
 Would discuss with an agent
 The supervisor was very helpful when my problem of rcving unwanted flash msgs and promptly forwarded the complaint
 Very good service
 It took Vodafone 3 months to reverse my wrong billing and that too after many visits to the store.. .
 excellent service, which shows that you really care to address the humblest subscriber's concern, without looking down on him ; quality of after sales service reveals your company's commitment ; it would have been nice if mr arunkumar, appeared fully alive to the customer's needs, without simultaneouslyfiddling the keyboard, entering the details of another service seeker ; great service ; keep improving to better the best ; thanks
 Prompt and positive action with warm interaction .
 Greet the customer with smile . I felt as if I was imposing on their turf
 The representative was extremely friendly and precise in explaining the requirements of documents and I was out of the store in a flash after completingmy formalities .
 MYANYSERVICES PROBLEM CLEAR SATISFIEDWAYWITHOUT WASTING MY TIME
 Totally ur store executive response is very positive
 A smile at the store would have made me rate u all at 10
 Fast customer friendly modest efficient staff
 p it up .
 Overall everthing good
 It took me 7 rounds to vodafone store located at 8 kilometers from my house . The associate over were not giving complete information about the method totransfer my sim from posrpaid to freepaid
 Clarified queiries badly . Not Dignified . Behaves rudly
 The executive who attended me was clear and did what needed to be done in a swift manner .
 Very very bad service . A lot of unnecessory formalities . Things not yet solved . A lot to write . But i am not ready to waiste my time .
 My work was completed with in 2min by your man . It is very good .
 Am satisfy for the service
 Customers friendly services
 You are the biggest mobile company of India...so you not need the customers like me . And no need to understand any problems of your user . The connectiontaken by my self so you are not responsible for any inconveniences . You see my account ...and think .thanks
 Exemplary service, courtesy and help given by your store associate Ms Priya Maheshwari has made me decide to go for additional connections only from vodafone
 Fully,satisfied.most welcome .

 Very outdated policies . Should go to other countries and see the conveniences they have for customers

 They are doing malpractice with customer's bill amounts . So I 've got several times outgoing barred .
 The staffs were warm friendly and patient
 Aap ke store wale complent ka sugestion nahi karte
 Very good support by the porur store .
 VERY POOR RESPONSES, SERVICES AND FOLLOW UPS
 1. Qualification of Staff : more than 50% of ur staff is d'nt know how to solve d problem of customers they discuss with others & trying to help . 2. Proper service not provide to customer 3. Information of ur roaming area not provide, at time of customer get a connection of ur company . Myself experince is very bad, & I suffer this every bill .
 Very good
 Thank u
 The overall experience was good . The store associate were very helpful . Thank you .
 They are helpful and solved my pronlem
 The customer waiting facility is not good . Seating arrangements was not there, only three people can sit and wait . Rest we all had to stand for almost 45
 Very humble and timely delivery right tho our for strep.everything very well taken care
 Allover ok
 Service is very good as others . Mostly i faced problems in others about network . Many times the phone networks problem .But not in vodafone as others networks . Secondaly the internet is also very good as compare to others plans .
 One of your executive have timepassed with me by registering a fake complaint and he had given me a fake complaint id voda service is slower in activating packs
 Very quick and prompt service
 Gud behaviour quick service
 Good Service .
 g arrangement is not adequate and finally, I wouls like to say that the services provided by vodafone in the past were more economical . To issue a new prepaid number i was quoted 650rs today . In the past I had payed 30rs . : )The staff seems friendly n helpfull . But, a bit slow in catering all the customers. . And no display for the current token number in the store . The seatin
 It tooks lots of time for my turn.. . My number was 42 they assisted 43-44-45-46 and after an hour called 42 which seems unfair as they all came after me
 They very kind and explain everything clearly
 Good behavier , good customer service by your staff . One thing from your co . This is my 3rd conection ,I am waiting my gift as per your co.Pumplet .
 Wrong commitment by attendant in July abt Gujarat free roaming .
 The Knowledge of Store CCE is very poor .
 Waiting period is very long . Only 3 persons attending customers . Pls increase the staff to attend the customers and save their time .
 What's the hell my no . 9792213686 has not activated no network in new sim issued plz solve this issue yesterday o have been submitted all documents
 Your staff needs to be taught on how to clam an displeased customer
 Recivie bagundi... .
 Plan revision made should make a good difference
 Where is my bill ? So far I have been paying without any bill . Your call center heard my request but didn't act . Your store staffs simply rejected my comp
 Its best service .
 Serviec was fast n executive was very helpful n fast
 the interaction was good. . the executive was understanding but the vodafone service is faulty. . every month i am facing the same kinds of issue but still
 10/9
 I have ported out of Vodafone . Never mind !
 Good
 When your store has been charged as per a duplicate sim Rs.100, that not issue but; when the offers or rechage a part of not given my number . Suppose when I like to take new sim including the new offers are available now @ same/less money ?? . Then why should take the duplicated sim at that amount .
 Bad attitude to the customer . The staff are absolutely not willing to solve my problem, which has arisen because of the staff . The answer to any question: "will work later" or "call 198". I will try to solve the problem in any way, so as not to come to the office !
 good responce and nice experience
 ot the least...my problem hasn't been solved yet.. .
 Service is very good .
 I was good . Dealing is awesome . I got the understood each & every thing . Also, I am fully satisfied with a cooperation .

 Gud and excellent
 Very unlikely

 Excellent
 I had two issues bcoz of which I had to go to the store . First I wanted a new usim as old usim was faulty now & secondly I got an offer via SMS to recharge with Rs . 71 to activate the bonus card & suppose to get Rs . 14 as cash back which I have not got it yet . So I told the store rep about the same . He helped me only with getting a new usim but for the cash back of Rs . 14 he asked me to come back again once the new usim is activated . I just don't understand why he could not do it as he could have checked the system & SMS that I received & could have resolve the issue . But I was asked to come back later which I did not like as time is very precious for everyone which I think he failed to understand .
 xpected . It's in Infosys office Bangalore
 Service is prompt
 Staff was really good
 No proper response .. No proper attention to customer.. . No proper respect customers concern ..
 Very satisfied
 Priority counter was open but nobody was there to attend premium customers . On top of this I had to wait more than 30 mnts that too in the store only .
 Reasons are many.one of the reasons is that we are getting 2g speed at 3g price .
 Immediate attrntion, got replacement of sim in matter of minutes, pretty impressed
 10 on 10 of course .
 Vodafone did not activate my internet plan . Because of that I was highly Over charged .
 Excellent service however the time taken to activate 3G is too long
 Due to cooperative & good behavior of staff .
 It was wonderfull w
 Yes
 Even though your service with reps are good but kindly make u IVR/AVR more easier to reach a rep when we call the customer service number .

 ed either by the customer care helpline or by the Vodafone's employee . When I wanted to lodge a complain they did not accept it . I have been a Vodafone uof the employee they simply denied it . You can check and see the records of my network complaint during October and November still my problem wasn't solv . And net pack will not be refunded to my reissued number . When I told them to give this to me in writing on a stamped Vodafone letterhead with the namea different number . When I visited on 22 nov I was told that I would only get the same number if I converted to postpaid connection for at least 3 monthsI had to go to the Vodafone center 4 times in order reissue my number .

 Vodaphone store is the worst store in the
 Really sorry to say but very dissappointed with your services no positive action from your end to redress our grievance so far
 Not respecting committed words
 Staff are kind and helpful in fulfilling customers
 I had gone to claim a gift on this number, on which they replied that stock is not available, come after 10 days then we will see, what can be done . Secondly, I visited also for PORTING of a number, on which they told "PREPAID SIM for PORTING is not available . You may visit on/after 18th of Dec . for the very purpose ."
 Good service keep it up.proud to be vodafone user.thank you .
 ress regularily but no action has been taken while 4 months have elapsed and I m not receiving bill on paper with complete details of all calls etc .
 They even not tried to understand the isssue
 Some of the employees are friendly, some are efficient . Many seem to stare at their computer screens for a long time . It seems that their connrctions aretoo slow or the online forms they fill are too complicated and badly designed . They have to process customer requests in minimum time - otherwise our wait becomes agonisingly longer and the queues too !
 Vodafone rocks.Store service was promptly awesome,executive Gyan wasquite supportive .
 Helpful, efficient, polite, knowledgeable
 Free and friendly approach.they giving very much attention and care to the customer

 very quick service by pallavi
 The executive i met was well trained frm vodafone and she wil reach at high position of vodafone
 Individual service was excellent but overall organisational operation unpleasant too long waiting spells for 1 person to handle the desk
 Very Good
 Only i can say is very worst store of vodafone .
 Wrong commitment, Not ready to accept their mistake, n I will see to that I will port my other number from Vodafone
 I ask for my bill statement and staff including manager unable to give me satisfactory answer and finally they denied to give my bill statement without any logic
 No body there to guide how to use international calling card,
 First try understand for what purpose we making presents in your store .

 Good service
 Mr.Dullal at the your store was decent,respectful & had the clear understanding what the customer expects from Vodafone .

 Comment in single sentence coild be "Vodafone Store do have a concern for their customers"
 All staff is gud
 Staff in the Malad west store was v helpful . Specially Gautam (Store Associate) was very supportive . Vodafone service is also v good .
 Vwry very slow on response

 Friendly atmosphare and good services provided by staff
 Good system for custmer feed back for vodafone service
 Rs . 99 was deducted from my balance yesterday . When I enquired about it with store associate he told u might have clicked some link, however I explainedhim that I have not used my phone for duration of 5 hours so how cud I click any link.....he simply told me to contact 198 or 9820098200.....wud u assistme in getting my balance back ?
 I visited vodafone store 4 times..still the associates didn't understand my problem. .
 Good
 Amazing and superb infrastructure,vibrant colour used for bubble texts and nyc uniform
 Horrible Service
 I would say i was not satisfied with the response by you people.Day by day your services are getting detoriated.If my problem is not solved as soon as po
 I had probl_e'm in data425rscharges
 I was waiting o counter and your representative was busy in download software on hi mobile . He not replying me . Just enjoying his mobile
 When i visited the store they told me that my problem will be resolved within 2 hours, but its more than 24 hours and problem is as it is .
 I m very happy with service of priya awasthi
 It was to the point and with clear understanding of my query .
 My questions were not answered . Customer care did not get in touch wid me . I would not recommend vodafone to anyone
 suggestions from staff helped a lot
 Experience
 Bad experience with the guard and the vodafone executive
 Reduce the services charges .its expensive
 To get caught in the middle of no where with no connectivity on a business visit is a nightmare . It's early days , but my first impressions are rather poor . I had been with Reliance for 8 years never I have had such a problem
 Very smart and knowledge person .. Explain me properly .
 I was fully satisfied with the interaction and my doubts were cleared on the spot
 No comments As I don't feel it is really going to help
 ing for us to visit again and again . We appreciated her goodwill . The Lady associate's name was Ms. Kinjal .
 The way of taking
 The reason is very simple as I m not getting the desire plan I want e.g there is plan called 499 red plan which you say not for me why ? it means ur business strategy is not good if u kept plan open which even your company advertise than how can you deny that plan to your customer say we cannot give you this plan, you should understand the need of customer and not only concentrate on your services but money also matters in india hope you understand
 Always happy to help
 Short waiting time . Excellant service by floor manager and Mr. Rony who was very knowledgeable, polite and efficient .
 My problem was solved quickly without having to wait. .
 Great
 Rather than being trained, ur staff's behavior is robotic, they are more interested to convince the customers inspite of solving there problems,
 You overcharge . I have old package, you never say if there is a better package . You only care about your own profits .
 Great customer orientation Job done quickly
 There should updates /pop up for any kind on balance deduction as every penny counts
 Very cooperative
 Please make some more sitting arrangement for waiting costumers and different counters for small queries .
 I wait for 30 minutes even some service windows were free . My more than 1 hour has been wasted and I did not get any service at all .
 know for what reason I asked him his reply was only can't do it.. . Useless service and I am going to cancel all my connections from you
 The executive named Mukesh mewara was very professional competent and action oriented .
 Poor network (2G+3G), Promotions schemes deter existing data users
 Que system was not followed proprely
 Ex . Were cooperative helpfull .
 Improve signal quality... .
 Well I was v v upset from the last week n was thinkng to change my connection but when yestday I came to ur store n had a talk...then after 15 mins my problm was solvd as u peopl said...so nw m really satisfied..thanx a lot... .
 Pathetic interaction
 The store associaties just do timepass They think the customers are just fools They make the customers to wait and wait.. .
 Why am I charged for a sim replacement when it's a network problem and it's a corporate plan .
 Experience with executive was fine but not very happy with the plans offered . There is no good plan for STD
 Communicaton with Store associate was helpful to know the overall procedure .
 Overall expwrience was good . The lady explained fully to my satisfaction . My doubts were cleared .
 Good and quick response
 Very bad service. . automatic network regester fail coming. . As when i need to make a importent calls . Network braking . Bad signals. . Even high cost 3Gdata plans . . OVERALL I'M NOT COMFORT ON YOUR SERVICE.
 No priority service was given . Syed and saleem were adament and stubbern . They make their own rules . Nothing was resolved .
 Executive were not all available ,had to wait for one hour... . They didn't had a proper answer to my query and were very rude ..
 I had a pleasant experience & the store associate Ms. Sakshi negi was very helpful and patient . Thanks .
 Your service was very fast
 Quick response, was free in 10 min . Only issue with Vodafone is that my limit is 12500 n I receive 20 calls a day if my bill is due even for 2 days .
 The staff was very helpful . He listened to my concerns n offered immediate solutions for that . However the no of staff in the store could be increased
 Ask the reasons ..from your employees....i m going to port my number.. . Thanks
 The service I required was attended well and was well executed
 I am fully satisfaction to vodafone service
 Store associate are good and helpful but network need to improvement
 I was asked for data card Sim, and your people active talk plan . I was visited 3 times to solve this issue, every time he said it will active by 2 days,but til date nothing . Only you are sending rental bills, and I will not pay for it .
 What I want he understand properly with co-op nature . Best regards from my heart .
 Even repeated store visits does not get things done . I have been waiting for a week for a change in plan and visited the store 3 times .
 Vodafone service centre executives are enabled with good system, domain knowledge . But Vodafone network connectivity has deteriorated over last 1-2 months . There have continuous instances of phone not getting connected, call drops, etc .
 Understood my case
 Wasted 1 hour there due to your confused staff .
 Store Associate was very courteous . Overall it was a well organized & hassle free process .
 ..
 y new no to vodafone I was been given assurance from your executive . But now after activating my new no they r differing n says that I will not get a sinThe service I wanted was delayed . Still it will take 7 days . I wanted to add my new no in the same plan with single bill for both the no . While adding m
 Executive girl briefly explain the detail . She response all my question after store closed
 Un happy with plans and un happy with network even after giving complaint they have not taken any interest
 Vodafone has become insensitive to customer complaints in recent times . I am ur customer for past decade but no serious approach takento resolve problemsof customers . Call drops is very frequent internet is slow n not available inside home/ office . Kindly seriously go through complaints made and not attended for nearly 2 months!!!!! ! Due to attractive n better plans by others and good net work by ur competitors you can face loss of good customers ......Need for your serious involvement in customer care.... .
 Terrible experience . You cannot resolve customer issues
 Am glad to give my views for such a nice dealing at tht mini store.Mam help me a lot n am very happy by their service
 Quick n courteous service
 Whe I entered store They asked to wait for few minutes to just take token reason was it will be in queue that was discussing
 I didn't get final solution for the query which i raised .

 I meet with prdeep he was very helpful and honest about his work
 Y
 Gud service
 Store executives were not at all helping, instead they were rude in replying as well as lack of product knowledge .
 Informed incorrectly about the process
 Store assitance say that your query will hear by punit and and executive punit was not available today .
 Agent nitish singh is very polite and good understandable.when i had problem i start shouting on him but he was handle a good face to face interaction wito be as a one of the customer . Thanks
 Your dedicated relationship call center is pathetic
 No Comments
 2 and December . But I still have not received the receipt .
 Exelent
 I loved the way service rep was interacting.she was ver calm nd patient nd was very understanding . She was very nice nd was helping understand the plans
 My favourite is vodafone
 Need to improve more in the ambience . Overall wait in queue is reduced
 tely they just try to shrug away with responsibilities by giving Tat .
 Very good experience good job
 Too much waiting time . Only one cash counter .
 your customers .
 maximum of my friends and relatives use and appreciate voda
 It took me 2 hours to reach Vodafone service centre to collect nano sim . They refused and said it's not there and it will take 3 days . So I was not at all happy with it and it's seems we can't even rely on Vodafone service centre .
 doc even bank statement and salary statement . And your store representatives are not at all happy to help . And the ****** so called 3G network is waste.There is no cell tower in my area and due to this I have no network at all in my home . My services have been suspended 4 times even after submitting allYour services are **** and I did a BIG mistake porting from Relaince to Vodafone..will definately port to Airtel after baring with vodafone for 3 months .
 My problem was not given any proper solution and i having loss of money .
 satisfied customers . Thanks Vodafone .
 9 because l feel lot of time can be saved with quick service at the store . We have to wait for long time . 10 because once the person attends youhe is polite , helping understands your requirements & all help is given
 The service provided by executive . Ws good he met the expectations .
 nice services provide me that's why
 Your store staff was very helpful and soft spoken they did try their best to solve my problem however my problem did not get resolved and that is what matters the most, i will have to visit your store again ( third time) to resolve the same issue that is internet connection not getting connected or net too slow over 3G.
 I would like to share one thing that one of representative denied to process my reuqest...being a corporate customer i will not appreciate this...but thanks to Mr.Nishant who.helped me and processed my request
 Your customers care executives misguide the consumer and not try to solve their problems .
 Promt attention
 Sir mai apni sim prmanently band krwana chahta hu, but mera itna time ni k mai khud vf store aa sku, at vf store wale keh re hai k khud ko ana padega . Or
 Firstly i want to tell that when i was entering to your store ground water/furrow was coming out nd the entrances was looking really dirty
 Very unhelpful .
 Work was done in a real helpful manner, promptly and with enthusiasm . It was a truly customer delight for me . Thank you .
 awesome service by sales executive . (Sardar G & Store Team).........Great Experience :)
 The who had serverd me is good . Especially a lady who had served me al last moment her name is i think MONISHA. K THANKS VODAPHONE
 Service not good because they not listen their customer problem all staff busy
 I wanted a micro sim in exchange of my normal sim. . Waited for 30 mins in queue for my turn. . Told the executive Saikat my req .. After all verification
 Not satisfied,only payment received,give any details for A _XX/C S.
 The executive told that he can't take request for future deactivation . Though the senior took my request instantly for the same . I think it is the problem is with the proper training .
 Vodafone mini store provide detail about my choice no and infomation about plans
 The executive was responsive, do you have special desk for very old customers ? Customer retention type
 Get some help for people who are not a localite of that particular state .
 Quick response.And the correspondent was good .
 Person guided me at gate '
 Ur team is well . Equiped with solution I am delighted
 This time staff is very good and cooperative .
 @@The customer care executive was busy on the phone and left while still talking on the phone and kept me waiting for good 5-7 mins in the middle of ourconversation . @@my friend visited the store with me and they were not able to solve her problem efficiently enough as her calls to the 111 got barred . @@n i finally get hold of him on the phone ,he is behaving as if i m his servant and he is doing a great work by listening to me . Overall i am very dissatisfied and will probably port soon . Good luck with your behaviour . @@
 My complain isnt being solved yet .
 Time taken to attend to a customer involves waiting time of more than 1.5 hours . This is terrible!! !
 You r the best among the lot . Keep it up
 Had interctd wth deepika,, she was polite nd resolvd my issue
 Your executive takes too much time to attend customer, misbehave and do partiality with customer
 The staff over der doesnt hv any knowledge wats so over re: i-phone .
 A good experience
 Its too lengthy procedure can you call back or provide me an email id . I will write a written complaint to vodafone .
 Very good service
 Excellent service
 Because all went smooth i was oyt in 3 mins flat. . Sadly u keep wait fr long. . Really bad on tht part . The person i spoke to yesterday was very helpful and nice
 It is better if time taken for the service can be reduced .
 Made cash payment on 11th dec for mobile bill which was not processes till 13th afternoon . I have to visit mini store to remind them . Thete is no tally or rechecking system in this outlet . Also the arrogant behaviour experienced from store executive .
 Didn't have any difficulty in starting phone
 The store associate understood my problem and offered me a satisfactory solution . Hence the ratings .
 Reason is simple . Your associates are stupid . you have all bunch of ****** working in Vodafone gallery .
 Prompt response to queries .
 My recharge is a problem
 Try using scanners for documents . I got my SIM replaced most easily, however wasted time looking for a shop to copy my ID as the copier in store was inops .
 Because I got the service within an hour .
 No resolution provided . I was getting a sim error post porting to Vodafone, and the associate just passed the buck
 The service was fast
 The set up and presentation of store and its management is good..but vodafone is going down quality wise..I'm not satisfied with the quality of service
 Itz was good
 Yes very good
 Good service
 I was charged twice for a single service and wasn't even given an explanation on visiting the store .
 Awesome .
 satisfied;-) wid services
 Good response and do a great job
 The wait was very long . More executives are required
 Happy wid services o
 I visited for roaming ready to deposit Rs 3000/ but were told vodafone's inability to accept today /being sunday . This was the disappointment . Will now visit tomorrow on monday . This is a hassle .
 Takes too much time for a customer to be attended, I can see representatives loitering but not attending to customers, most of the time only about half the counters are operational
 0 raiting
 Good response on request made and query raised.thanks
 I SATISFIED
 Co-operative nature of associates
 The store is very helpfull
 Whenever I go to the store . The staff smiles and welcome gives good respond and immediately take actions regarding the complaints
 There was long que.. . only three seats were in working condition
 Long waits for every service
 ******** service call me if u really handling services
 It was a quick n very friendly service by the representative.. . Tnx
 I wanted yo switch from postpaid to Prepaid, but even after visiting the Vodafone Store, my query was not resolved
 There is no network coverage in my office, i cant talk and no 3G(even 2G) coverage .  DLF IT Park Sector 62 Noida
 Very helpful & useful & nice Services
 Wait time high due as only 2 associates were at their desk, which is 5 in full strength Participation of staff in attending to the customers and guidingthem with solutions lacking Need to be more proactive
 I had to travel twice for a simple sim activation . The personnel were not responsible at all .
 The agent seemed to be in hurry, like as if he needed to get somewhere . A little less interested in resolving issue .
 Was happy with today service
 It was nice visit and the staff was very helpful .
 Resolvd my issues.. . Nd m satisfy wth the services provided by vodafone
 Store Management is ok . associates were well trained .
 I had issue with mgossip app and was charges Rs . 500 for that . But store guy just took complaint and said he can just take complaint and not resolve it.So what's the point of visiting the store . Further if problem persist ill port to other service provider .
 Solution received instantly
 thank y for yr qiestions .
 Poor process.. . Inexp . Professionals.. . Not customer focused store .
 Keep it
 It was really gud that d query has been solved so quick
 Your associate was too fast and in hurry to close things . I suggest that he should have given more time to explain the plan properly
 Not up to the mark
 First rating 8 is quality of service.the second raring 1 was for 1 hr wait u made me do . Third rating 9 is for helpful personel and his politeness
 I am satisfied with ur service & quick action but it is only better to all othe network services,I want best .

 Yet to get confirmation from Vodafone about service saught .
 U can also solve these issues without making me run to ur store though mobile only but u r unable to do that.I had tried explaning the same thing to urcall centre personal but they don't want to understand .
 Frustrating service at Dwarka store only two executive were working rest were roaming here and their and having chitchat with each other when their is along queue and due to same most of people walk away
 Satisfactory
 In store all people treated veary kindly to me, am happy to your service . Thank you .
 They askd me 2 wait 3 DAYS SAME TIME WHY DISCRD MY OUT GONG CALS 3DAYS BACK?? ? I AM AN OLD CUSTMR!!!I WLL NT DENY UR PAYMT
 First of all my problem was bill was wrongly in the name of my husband despite the connection is in my name so I hd to visit the store n wasted my Time which should nt be bcoz the mistake was frm yr end n sufferers were we.secondly executive was very helpful who listened to us carefully n gave solutions but we still need an action against the person who did the mistake .
 First of all there is no clarity on your stupid connection policy . Then when i clarified it from your mini store in katwaria sarai they gave me wrong information . I wasted my precious time . Atleast all your store should be updated to give customer right information .
 Vodafone's service is really awesome and your executives are really helpful . Keep it up
 People don't understand d importance of others time . Least concerned with offering solutions . Providing complex procedure for simple tasks
 oper solution .. . So that user suffer less with your final solution
 Actually my vodafone 3g net has not been working due to sim problem, it is my mobile mistake at all..it is Vodafone sim card problem which are provided by you, he ready to give me exchanged sim but documents has not been carried by me that time..he told me to give all documents to me I told him that documents are already submitted by me. . my problems has not been resolved till evening. . I decided to transfer my net to from Vodafone to idea 3G. Hence forthI will not utilize Vodafone service. . it is your loss due to customer dissatisfaction. .
 Rating 10 out of 10
 Very good services from Vodafone. .
 We are quite satisfied with the service provided by the staff, their behaviour was good , listen us patiently and resolve the problem without wasting the minute
 I am not satisfied with ur service coz i dont get possitive answer frm ur side always u ppl tell some silly reason
 Service is extremely poor and in this fast world you can expect your client wait for 50Minutes for turn . Half of the table empty and no staff available.Need to look in to this problem seriously .
 Less staff was on the job therefore had to wait 20 minutes, photo copy machine was jammed, the saving grace was that it took 10 minutes to complete documentation and hand over the new sim, activation was fast and hassle free .
 Store must have tea/coffee &water service .
 I m happy with the detail's and service given by nikhil regarding my no....i am totally satisfied by your service thank's
 It was just going in n onut experience , the services given to us were excellent n within minutes Really appreciated

 The billing process of Vodafone is very bad . The speed at which Internet is
 Hi , the store experience was good but the brand experience was not . I recently migrated from prepaid to postpaid and was looking for a cheaper blackberryplan . But you don't have one . The 299 plan u have is for BBM (really ? Who uses bbm?) The reason of my low rating was the lack of options otherwise everything's great .
 EXECUTIVE WAS HIGH TEMPERED AND RUDE AND RESPONDED BADLY
 I m visit your vodaphone store for issue a duplicate sim and your executive charge 100 rs and give me m-pesa app i don't want dis m-pesa app
 Prompt response
 Because they staff was helpful, attentive and efficient
 Vodafone is bad company

 Very Nice
 Net very slow & call rate very high
 The store which I was visited yesterday is the worst Vodafon store ever . I have to wait for 2 hours only to talk Vodafon executive .
 Wair time too long
 I am 65plus.Tried to sort out the problem of non working of 3 of our mobiles by phoning 111 from my this no.Nothing happened by switching off & removingbattery & simcard and reassembly . .Hence we went to the gallery in ghatkopar west at 1015 hrs . Neelam did the samething and one of the phone started working.Other 2 also started working without anything and so we returned home thinking the problem is solved.But again the three phones found to be not working from noon onwards . Hope I am able to explain you sequence of events
 Good service knowledgeable agents .
 The store n execs r great. . ur sms timing is wierd .
 Very Good Sooriya
 MY PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVE EVEN I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
 Satisfied in all aspects
 Network Fully satisfied !
 Whn I had called ur help line no on 7 dec the person from your end kept me on hold more then 20 mints because he was not able 2 address my query he haddisconnected my cal after putting me on hold for 20 mints .when i visited ur vodaphon store Female to whom u had addressed my query was least bother whenI said becz of service issue I will disconnect your service she was ok she said if u want disconnect the service .your staff don't have any value for customer who is holding more thn 10 yrs of relationship with u
 My rating reasons :- Ur store is 7 days open . I recd help for getting Token . And finally I recd proper answers To my queries . However ...... . for my same task i.e . for Ownership change of mobile phone sim only, at my Previos visit to the store I was told to bring some Documents . Today I took All the documents but The attendig mam Said NOC is also required . I requested that it was not Told to me at my previos visit but mam said NOC is must . Finally my task was not Fulfilled.NOC is not an Issue , I will get it . BUT MY HUMBLE REQUEST AND SUGGESTION IS THIS THAT PLEASE ASK UR STAFF TO GIVE A PRINTED OR HANDWRITTEN SLIP FOR WHATEVER ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STORE . IF THIS HAPPENS IT WILL NOT ONLY SAVE TIME AND MONEY OF OUR CONSUMERS BUT IT WILL ALSO SAVE TIME OF UR DEALING STORE STAFF AND GOODWILL AND RATING OF STORE/ COMPANY WILL DEFINATELY TOUCH NEW HIGHTS WITHOUT ANY DOUGHT .
 Although team is helpful, they need more empowerment to solve customer issues . Or there will be disappointed customers .
 Overall experience is good but process is time taken
 Have already made 8 visit to the store for kyc . The people do not know how to deal with the matter . Even now i am not sure if it will be done - definitel
 I just want to confirm abt payment but your volunteer told me to take coupan for such small reason
 Good service and satisfied with the promptness . Thanks .
 Visitors have to wait long without proper arrangement to sit & place seems very congested
 Everything went well on that day at store .
 Curect information given
 After my satisfied experience
 Very first thing is, all the staff are cooprative and they retain the customer in Postpaid only .
 Immidietly provide pre paid service
 It was very much pleasent service
 Your services are very slow.... . Vodafone red plan family creation n delinking procedures are very bad... . So people do not respond properly in that case... .
 SMS package is deactivated on 17th Sep, I received sms from Vodafone also . In OCT and NOV bill, sms charges are applied, I am coordinating from October to reversal of additional charges, but not yet done . I will not pay Bill if revised bill not receive before due date . Awaiting immediate action from Vodafone for additional charges reversal . If your team not taking responsibility, better to deactivate account and go with any other service provider .
 U fail 2 solve my problem leading 2 snap ties with u
 vodafone customer care system has not provide about usage of calls and left call balance with in period and source from where internet plan activate alsoTiming to receive call by customer care is long as description of internet plan takes lots of time
 Yes i m not satisfid vodafone servises because very expensive vodafone very high charges data pack call rate roming charges STV
 My enquiry to justify bill was not upto mark
 How satisfied were you overall with the SERVICE EXPERIENCE in our store, from 10 (very satisfied) to 0 (very dissatisfied) ? :- I replied 0 coz my requested service 3g was not activated
 I want to change my tarriff plan with less talk time & increase in data pack, but your executive was not able to give me a proper solution
 Promt response. . and handling customer problems as per their needs. . the service would have been much better
 Experience was too bad . Instead of solving problem they told whether you want stay with VF or not is your decision . For a 14 year + customer it seems veryridiculous . I have decided not to stay with VF.
 I had visited and my queries were solved and attended
 the service is a little bit slow, which could be improved .
 I asked the Rep to do a additional Internet pack . .However there was no response and after next day follow up to Vodafone care, I got to know, rep did anincorrect additional pack..She is not aware of additional packs
 Very good service for stor manager
 Overall satisfactory
 The reply given after complete listen the consumer grievances and try to solve according to his limitations . Further he forwarded to their concerned official .
 I went to activate 3g service but my 3g handset were in service so in local mobile i stored n went to store they told some steps which all i had done alr
 Very nice and quick action on replacement of my sim at free of cost. . Thank u. .
 Great

 Token system for communicate with store associate sometimes puzzled me a lot. .
 Wait time high . but service nice
 Totally Vodafone service is very very good .
 All the counters are noy working . Waiting time is more . Sitting arrangement is for only 2 persons in waiting area
 Vodafon store manager & exicutive rudly behave
 The people were rude and incompetent she removed the sim from my phone and did not replace it properly so it said no SIM card she refused to attempt it again Had to go to a regular mobile/ baniya shop to get it fixed again The entire experience was frustrating and I have to see if the new SIM card willbe couriered to me on Monday as promised or I have to go and waste time again I am so upset that if I don't get it in Monday I will change the carrier
 Though I had gone for a Nano sim card,which I was not issued due to some reasons your staff was very courteous towards me which I appreciate.Thanks and Regards
 All is good... .
 Last mnth i went to the VF store for Post to Pre the reps did nt give accurate info after long waiting i was rudely infd to come again wid all relevant docs
 Experience was good.. . systematic way of token...staff were knowledgeable.. . overall good.. .
 Therr are many customers. . They are not smiling at customers. . Power is not there no power back up.i went 3 times to the store in a day.iam happy the work is done. .
 I did not have to wait in Que . No waiting prompt service which is worth appreciable .
 Everything was done quickly without any waste of time . I appreciate the efficient services .
 The service was good
 Bhavya is a very good store associate, hence I am advising the incharge of this store to upgrade the postion of bhavya in store .
 They don't know actual business .
 This time I found the officer with no care attitude
 Staff were Cooperative, Confident and Responsive .
 Number of staff shoud be added
 Staff have good reason
 Make it more automated and make sound proof cabins so that people can interact freely
 Team not customer friendly .
 Customer understanding
 Bcoz of their good behavior,talking way and attending sense . I liked that..... .
 Mostly satisfied because they atleast told me where can i get my solution from . Not fully satisfed coz i expected d solution at d store itself regrdng roaming issue
 atically based on usage . It's been 3 months and I've been trying to increase my credit limit . I sent messages and emails as per the customer care's advice . It's pathetic . This idea of increasing the credit limit automatically and not letting the user do it is a really poor decision . Please look into this.I was on Roaming and I had to go to a Vodafone store and have a security deposit and all they give me is a request number . Im still not sure if that'llincrease my credit limit . Such a small thing, but no easy way of getting it done . Really dissatisfied! !
 Archisman was the guy I spoke to and he was rude and didn't want to help me and made me feel miserable as a Vodafone loyal customer
 Nice ambience, and prompt addressal of concerns, with a smile...overall very professional approach .
 Instead of activating my vodafoe red plan quickly, ex . Offered me some other plans with lesser benefits .
 V efficient, courteous
 I was given my desired information .
 Attendants at store are very inteligent & cooperative . Realy they are happy to help .
 great experience
 Except cloudy weather 9. Inhouse it is not good
 I had an excellent experience to be there and the person i met sumit is very quick and helpfull to understand and resolve my issue .
 Heard patiently, understood the query and try to solved .
 My problem is not resolve till date .
 5 stars
 While entering to store welcoming security helping& guide to our problem relating to our mobile currency as well as other plan to need .
 It was really good and the associate was very fast in resolving the issue
 My experience has so far been at least in the last 4 to 5 years good . My ratings are guided by courtesy to me as a senior citizen and clear explanationsto my concerns .
 Nice .
 their answers towards the activations of some vas facility they couldnt explain how the vas activation were accured .so they were not answering any things regarding the billing .
 Very good and helpful experience
 Very good experince
 Superb experience
 Verry good
 For my prob they take 60 days to solve my problem
 I need to replace my sim
 Very supportive,
 Displine,Well manered,allthouh strengh of staff was quite low yet attending coustmers smmothly&happly .
 Your store associates do not have the Service experience as it was available five to ten years ago . Are they work ing under pressure ?
 Nice
 Good work by chandan
 Very satisfied with total experience
 Got what we wanted very quickly
 I HV a very long relationship with Vodafone n I enjoy its services
 Fun
 KNOWLEDGE , NATUR & TIMLY PROBLEM SHORTOUT
 I have a great experience with Vodafone.espacly the excutive Pradeep he was very good and have complete information . I think all cridt gose to these kindof employee and their service
 Finally me to coming to say Vodafone is the first and best ever than all other networks happy to be a part of it........but my negative comments and ratings are all due to worst response and delay in activation of plans in Vodafone store, palladam road tirupur makes my last two months bill above 1300 highly risk to pay so I am going to change my sim as Vodafone prepaid from this month.Eventhough they are not helping in change my number as prepaid it's myvery important contact number please help me soon .
 Efficiency of staff, helpful and good behaviour
 Prompt response and very fast activation
 Its best
 Store excucutive is very good executive it is very helpful for me
 Ur repsentatves behavior is not good
 I'm trolling between ur multiple stores for over an year n stil undone.By this weekend if its not solved I would switch all my services other service provider. . Jus FYI I've got 5 connections n same day would ensure all gets switched.. .
 They attend smart explain and finish my request as it is geniun and done the needfull at once
 me more than previous gonna cut off services soon
 Attitude problem though they say sir but it's like this is there job & they just have to do it they should be polite & serve with smile
 I found the people helping friendly ,they attended me promptly
 May be due to Lack of proper information and knowledge abt ur services . I think they treat their customers as fools .
 Good and knowledgeable associate who was able to provide good advice and guidance on the appropriate plan . Also not much waiting time .
 Actually I have visited to a hospital where no treatment available for my desease .
 10veri naes
 Not much . Prepaid sim is not given the same privileges as postpaid sim
 Overall good
 No reasons .
 Got the service with smile
 Too much delay in getting attended by the staff . Total waiting time spent 1hr 30min; actual service time was of 2.5min .
 I am really unhappy coz of Ur service postpaid
 NICE
 I have already come to your store several times, but you store executive failed to solve my query,  Your executive offered me for internet plan of 500 MB in just 51 INR, and will be activated in 48 hrs, he told .  and also told me that he will be give me a discount of INR 300 in current bill, but he failsin his both offers .  I have undetstand your service now, I have no any words to say about your service .  Your service is very bad in my openion
 Very good
 it was great experience first time wd vodafone.. . May be because of the store manager archana kale , she understood my problem and very quickly respondedwd solution . Every store manager should be equipped wd the same knowlede and customer oriented.henceforth will be using vodafone for all the trnsaction.thanx
 Your executive Pramilla Chauhan is very knowledgeable and sweet also.. . Give her a thanks by my side.. .
 I am from Delhi . Compared to Delhi connectivity is not good in AP and data network speed is also less .
 There was no complete resolution
 I and my family r satisfied users of vodafone . We always get reasonably prompt service expected by us . Please keep it up .
 PROMPT FULLY SATISFIED GOOD BEHAVIOR SMILING NO LAZYNESS TOTHE POINT
 My problem was resolved within 5 minutes
 Your basic policy is to earn money by hook or crook . Even u dont give service for which u charge . Ur staff tried their best at the time when I visited ur outlet to surrender / disconnection to linger on my problem n enquired the things which were not relevantto disconnect the dongle connection .
 We had visited the store for replacing sim . Staff attending wasnt briefed on simcard inventory by the senior officials .
 I am very happy to use the sim of vodafone but the internet charges of vodafone is little high so i suggest you that you will down the chrges of internet please
 To change from postpaid to prepaid I have to be connectionless for 24 hours .
 Not happy getting charged for missed call alert also your Internet is very slow
 Iam visiting so many time till no one doing better solution .. i hate vodafone service i will change this network..worst service. .
 I received good reasonable response for my queries and satisfied .
 Too time consuming
 Good and courteous service
 As i said that it was too time consuming & officers were short tempered
 The Vodafone store is awesome except that Pls improve customer handling and reduce the waiting time
 None.. .
 Great service! ! But please work on your network coverage .
 Vodafone is awsome but smtime is netwrk not wrk
 Its always a pleasure visiting d store . The staff is extremely helpful n cordial . I m using Vodafone since 2000 n have never felt d need to change my service provider . Keep up d good work . Wishing you all at Vodafone a merry Christmas and a happy new year .
 Every body send us to another employee, but nobody help us
 Customer service is best than other network
 Not able to resolve the issue
 Provides incorrect information to customer . Plan policy are not clear .
 s regarding my problem very fast in such a way like he was in some kind of rush or hurry . Rest of things were gud and your service is excellent .
 It helped me clarify the query and made me available a more convenient postpaid plan . Thanks .
 Good service but call rate offers are not good and minimum
 Q3-8
 staff response was reasonable enough
 First respond to my complaints that I have raised from store and later I would give you the feedback .
 Maruthi is the tailer made executive in vodafone and vodafone in the best services provider
 Your krishna nagar store staff is very irritating they only tell to switch to postpaid for every problem what the hell they dont have any solution exceptyou should switch to postpaid and your preet vihar staff is good and the company should open another store in east delhi as preet vihar store is very overcrowded please open another store in east delhi
 Service was good .
 All very nice but the token system is not well
 Great experiece very good and knowlegable person mr asim he solved my problem within few minutes
 Store associate kept me waiting for an hour after I generated token from kiosk .
 it's quick and easy rather contacting helpline no .
 Vodafone is getting a pain for customers I saw around 99 per cent of customers irate and unhappy . I had a small issue and it took a around 3 hours for me to go thru and that is still incomplete I had to pay extra 500 rs for no reason very soon I am getting out of this fraud company and I will make sure Iwill bring down the business by telling my experience to many others smell the coffe before its to late for you guys as vodafone is loosing image in mumbai
 I had to wait for a long time to get attended by one of your store associate . But once I was there my issue was taken care of .
 He is very hardworking person and i satisfy him
 I was wrongly charged in november bill for 750 rs..rather than refunding the money vodafone is trying to give lame excuses..this happened with my airtelas well....but they refunded money instantly
 Quick response.......but a smile will help
 1) not proper attention given . 2) some sort of bureaucratic dereliction creeping into ur staff . 3) not efficient what they used to be some 6/7 years back . 4) not properly trained to make social n healthier atmosphere
 To be very frank ur reps are not pertinent to the customer querries.Fixed answers.Email to me from vodafone on 9th dec clearly stated offer of rs10 for mci activation.When activated charged rs 30,which is un ethical.All my email to corporate assist resulted in vague replies.I will be satisfied only when uactivate my missed call information for rs 10.Henceforth dont fetch for ratings when nothing relevant done from ur side.Thank u.Jai Hind .
 The reason is there was one men is not answering me properly & i want new connection but he doesn't show me number there after i have taked num from Reliance .
 aapki service aachchi hai , lekin jab mai 198 par call karta hu to customer care executive ka number nahi lagta . meri baat bhi nahi ** pati . yehe problempermanent solve kar dijiyee .
 The service of ur store is quite good n response against any complain preety well .
 It was an educative and enjoyable experience with a touch of meeting of meeting client expectation .
 after 3 month get prepaid converted . She told sim cannot be replaced . I raised complaint in customer care and had waste time following up .
 Happy to experience your motto HAPPY TO HELP in true implementation !!
 My net speed very slow
 Waiting till is on the higher side generally at any store . Was very happy with the conversation we had with the executive
 They got the problem and helped me out ...did it fast ...and they where great
 My resion for this rating is that he listen & understand my problem & provide me good solution
 Some of The staff were not fully aware of the information some of them said that there will be a an issue in my phone Then the senior of staff said validity of sim is expired
 I want to convert my postpaid individual connection into Corporate connection.... . But your executive didn't allow me to do the same
 In your store waiting period is long
 Ideal, well trained, sincior & co-oprative persn at VODAFNE STORE
 From 7 days i was getting network error every body is saying we could not do anything from here . In roaming how could I call when my only sim is not working .
 Good
 Good atmosphere and prompt service .
 I asked several questions about my bill plan and had other queries to the Vodafone associate . He replied all my questions and made me understand patiently . His pleasent attitude satisfied me a lot .
 I was fooled by ur prepaid plan . When i said i wil go for mobile number portability . The store guy without hesitation said go
 Executive is concerned "Full Marks to him" and I wish him "Good Luck".
 I am very happy with vodafone
 I requested to deactivate 1gb 2g plan and I don't know it is deactivated or not... . No msg or notification I got till now regarding my request... .
 Good
 Good
 Without knoladge workers
 X
 only I can switch
 The staff was good but the solution couldn't be provided to the customer .
 Speed at service staff very slow . Always i have to wait more than 1 hour
 Well organised and friendly .
 i m totally sataisfed wid sadaf she is a gud very gud agent
 Resolution was not reached at time of visit . Representative emailed and said I will be contacted in 4 days . It should not take that long for a resolution .
 Good cooperation from your executive to resolve the issues
 It's good do its further also
 First of all representative is not from technical background so unable to understand the issue . Secondly she was not willing to register my complaint Third: representative not able to ans the question . Fourth: not received any msg regarding complaint id so a big question mark whether she has registered my complaint or not .
 Its my pleasure that i am a voda custmer
 No comments
 Understood Well What Was Required & accordingly Delivered . Gud Show ::

 Your customers service executives were very help ful and the process was well organised .
 Good experience but had to go to the centre to ssolve the issue . It would be better if customer care can resolve on phone itself .
 The personnel seemed less interested in answering the queries . Also they took a lot of time to revert in spite of hardly any customers . Plus, I m not convinced with reason given for my query
 Long wait at store, store executive was not warm or welcoming, store too crowded .
 It is near to station so good to interact with your representative . +ve talk . And negative is waiting time is high
 Poor complaint redressal . Very worst method of handling

 Best service by ratan
 Good
 That was really nice experience and your all executives were really cooperative
 I am not very satisfied with the service and have been with vodafone from years but now the service and network has dipped worst . I pay every month on anaverage of 800 and have logged many complaints for network issues . This has not resolved till date . Pathetic service! !
 Your service is so good, hence I've given 9 points for.1st que . Last time when I tried to speak to customer care executive, there is no such option..I felt helpless and forced to travel to Vodafone store.hence 8 points for.2nd one . While interacting with store associate he was unable to solve or either understand my problem..he was convinced later.hence I gave 6 points for the last one . Thank u
 There were only 1 associate . Thats why so much rush . Please improve that service
 I have visited thrice to vodaphone store unfortunately after multiple assurance my outgoing calls are still not activated yet
 Your service is awesome.. .
 Long waiting period .
 Mera bill mere ghar tk nahi ata h or jita mai cal karta hu usse adhik bil bharna padta hai
 All is ok.. . Nyc servic...grt netwrk.. . Thank you
 Manner of store associate is good.they just understand my problem and wait there for me after closing time .
 I have two postpaid connections . Wanted to synchronize the billing dates for both . The guy was not at all willing to help me saying he can't do anythingas I have corporate plan .
 To bad activation prossing and the minjur mpesa agent id not good. .
 A pleasant smile and a prompt service what a customer looks for is a package in your store . Keep it up . V. Chopra, Former Scientist, DAE, GOI
 It's totally unfriendly experience . Already requested to port out
 GOOD JOB BY RATAN & BEST SERVICE
 Very supporting attitute.Services very gud .
 ous is the word for this kind of service from Vodafone .
 Long waiting is the main reason for reducing the scores .
 We were charged Rs- 884 in 10 min without any reason . We feel like robbed.. .
 Overall a good store . It was a great experience in contrast to another airtel store .
 D83DDE0AD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1FD83CDF1F
 Good! !
 I would suggest you to make your process visit free . Why should a customer visit your store for services like deactivation , post to pre paid etc
 Lack of knowledge in staff, incorrect information, time consuming and pathetic service
 Best ever service given, 3 problems resolved in 10 mins. .
 I reached bandra vodaphone at 10.am...took token (60)..and my number came at 11.am.....not many ppl....then too took so much time
 Your RED service is pathetic ..... . In store experience better
 Working con fast & Fine
 The speed at which my query was resolved
 Very cooperative and prompt reply
 No proper importance given to the customer by your representative & no proper explanations provided about the schemes .
 It would be better your rep visits at our factory address for details .
 I know my problem but your communication is good .need full .
 Your executives are very good and would like to appreciate bhaskar and jatin for their quick and effecient wrk
 Over all experience is good . Thank you .
 Good quick Now it is require flexibility towardas customer in market competitor doing so many activity
 ahai .
 It was a good experience.. .
 It was a very pleasant experience at the store and our concerns were properly addressed .
 M complain abt my plan n i hv visisted vodafone store also but no change in my plan m so unhpy wid bodafone
 Store Mgr has worked simply with to activate and verify my no.. .
 Thanks to garvita tripathi fr special assistance .
 The executive who attended me was very helpful
 When dialing* 121# I was offered 1Gb for rs 127, when it is was exhausted . This offer is not coming . I had to recharge for rs 195. When this offer will comeback or I have recharge for rs 195 only always from now onwards ?
 I port in my number from idea to Vodafone . While port in, Vodafone informed me roaming will be free in maharashtra n goa but now in first bill roaming is charged and even in store visit response was very poor and my issue is still unresolved . Everyday I roam in maharashtra and this is absolute fraud .
 Sir we port to vodafone from reliance company, u told that u give us 100 sms per day tha 1/2 paise per second.But we dnt get that offer,so we r nt sufficiant with u sir .
 Customer Service at Vodafone store is excellent but the network is becoming poor day by day . Even after obtaining 3G services it became a nightmare for me . Network always fluctuates and goes into emergency mode after each call .
 Waiting time can be reduced . I went there just for a sim replacement and had to wait for 15 minutes
 I am very happy with your executive and thanx your executive to help
 The staff was very help & courteous . Also was helped with special senior citizen service token.Thanks .
 Good prompt practical responsive approach
 I dont no
 Your showroom service is good.But your datacharges are very high .your man explain how to make margin limits,in 15sec . You dedect rs10 as data charge .feel bad .
 No proper receiving and not getting solution for the problem
 There were lack of attenders I experience
 The attendant was not sure of her answers . Two others also gave me wrong information re . International roaming . The process took 25 minutes .
 U ppl had nyc n good excutives like mr.ajith, he is a cashier of ur org, but he wrk lyk a store manager realy I had good experience with him, so pls giveon bow from my side
 More schemes sh_o`uld be made available for 3g net at low prices
 Not only the customer service executive in the store but also the security guard are very help, it's much appreciated
 Many of the service counters were free then also i was asked to wait a lot..Moreover, i was insisted a lot not to go for prepaid sim.i dont knw why..i was not in mood of negotiation over that then also they kept insisting..for m pesa nd all. . I mean..they should definitely persuade customer for couple ofbenefits for any service/plan etc . But if customer is not ready for that...then he should not be forced..isnt it..it wastes the valuable time .
 I had my personal experience with your staff . Vodafone staff very pleasant to attend the customer .
 Associates not friendly
 ssured me that I will receive message within 2 hours
 I waited for 50 minutes . Even I talked to floor manager . Then people were attended . You should have kept all 5 counters filled with Associates . Five other customers waited for 45 minutes or more .
 Very nic experience...there executive given me solution very smartly..i m impressed
 The representatives response was very pathetic . They don't care about anybody there. .
 Bad response from the Kollam outlet. . No one is serious about their job. . If my company allows me to change the service provider I will definetly changeit. . I have given one request on oct 20 th again I gave the same request on nov 3 rd still my query is not solved yet. .
 The reason for which i changed my sim is not fulfilled i.e . network problem Still i am facing network problems
 1st I want to appreciate for your kind support and patience . I used to like the service and network, this is the reason I am using the Vodafone from 6years and the Major reasons for dislike are, I didn't receive feedback on time for my requests and complaints, and so on . Overall ratings are good and needmore improvement . Thanks, Naveen .
 It was a good experience - your salesman was available with minimal waiting, understood what I wanted, provided it on the spot and adequately explained h
 OK
 Good staff
 Good atmosphere
 Quick service and well groomed executive . Very co-operative
 not pay my current bill till then .
 Frindly staff
 1 of the best service executive of vodafone .
 Vodafone store , if i club up all, is people having good product knowledge, good service, correct guidance, one thing disappointing is long que, but maybe as like u r opening more vodafone stores it may be then hassle free.. . Than You. Reg, Purvesh Vora
 Its a fantactic experience to visit ur store
 It was great talking to the executive and the way he responded to the request .
 You must improve your service and how to talk with customer
 I cannot get through my relationship manager assigned to me for queries so had to go to the store .. . The store guy seemed to lost when I asked my questions . ..
 Please take strictly action against voda . mini store in nagpur . Who had forcely activated net plan on my mobile from aug . 14 And plesa please return mycharges which l paid for this plan . Thank you .
 The store associate Was very helpful and clarified all my queries .
 Kindly recheck my latest bill thoroughly
 Good response and service .
 Delay in every single thing you do & charge incorrectly in first place
 The vodafone service stands at number 1 in india but plz reduce the service tax which is added to bill or plz give some offer so our bill comes low .
 The problem with ur store associates was primarily the delay that they provide us in addition to quite rude behaviour . Apart from this everything went well .
 Doesn't have sound concept Example: we either download or upload over internet but executive told download upload and surf
 Very bad experience . Want to discard my service with ur team
 There z always a space for improvement in everything < Best Rgds Manoo ICARE Eye Hospitals & PG Institute >
 Very good services and mr . Abhinav goswami who is appointed in vodafone store 1 in udaipur is very co-opreative
 Courtesy, good response, efficiency
 I m very very dissatisfied for vodafone
 Being a Red Customer I had to wait for 1 hr to get to meet store executive for sim replacement request . Post he gave me form filled with details it tookanother 25 minutes to get simcard from cash counter .
 Hasome service given from executive i like the approach & clean information given abt net charges
 The person was too busy to answer my queries nor able to resolve my problems of internet through Blackberry Either he does not know how to resolve or I may be asking for moon in his view . I have already discontinued my datacard services from 2 numbers due to poor service- am a very old loyal customer of more than 12 years . It pains that I am not considered even as a normal customer This feedback will also be another routine with no action I am preparing to accept no response as expectation of better leads to severe disappointments Thanks
 Your representative Gaurav is not even cooperating...bad experience. .
 Yesterday I purchased 2 simcards; Vodaphone & Airtel from Peninsula park . And after comparing both the services I had given the ratings .
 Waiting period was too much . Waiting for 40-45 minutes just for SIM replacement is not at all acceptable . The agent didn't even know the balance in my account .
 I love Vodafone for all services
 Interaction was good but more workers required . Oueue was long .
 Worse than municipal office the in charge was not with proper language n no information
 I like vodafone for all services
 On the bill date 10th December I paid the amount at kallachi store.But till 12th December noon amount was not paid.So I take back the amount & gave it tonadapuram store at the same date they paid the amount on next day noon only after my call.Such incidents had happen several times before too.So I am very dissatisfied with ur ministores .
 Pls make a sitting arangement for the customer while on waiting list, in your store .
 I love Vodafone because of its network and you guys make services better by doing it quickly in store
 After speaking to customer care at 111 went to galeary
 Vodafone store is very smart
 Not given proper answer for query . Not any problem resolved
 Sorry we have no time plz dont disturb us .
 And a lot of people will post about vodafone postpaid billing
 Good
 Hai service is gd n nce. .
 Nice
 The procedure is very slow.. . 2 days over and yet the problem is not solved.. .
 Staff should not wrongly commit to customer .
 Call me I will tell u
 I want my 109 rs back
 Not happy
 olve it immediate . the problem is only with me,wrong data charges in my plan since I ported my number with you . so please fix it immediately . Thanks .
 rhis pently being levied.l am a senior citzen and feel harrased.Now while i am texting this msg Rs0.81 cost of volume consumed has been reflected.what is
 Ur network is proving unreliable these past several weeks . I had gone to complain about it to ur store . The associate Mukul was courteous n competent . He
 ult but none was sorry for it . Inspite they always directed me to do this or that .
 Coz my problem is not resolved no one has the answer abt it also they me believe tht customers are FOOLS to be loyal with Vodafone
 1. Whenever I have a problem I always visit the Vodafone Store in RT Nagar because of the quick solutions that the assistants provide . I have visited this store a lot of times and I trust that they always make things easy for me . 2. They do their job of assisting me very sincerely . I am assured that theyalways have a solution to my problems . 3. Right from the security guard to the assistant and the payment counter everyone were calm and understanding .
 The services is not good . I n my Kauleauge totally have 10 connection . But there is no network in our office . When we use call the customer care . The misguide us . The they are experience less . The cant understand our queried . So hence for the can solve . I m very disappoint with the sevice which we are getting from vodafone . Instant of Being old customer . N paying heavy bills . I Hope u vl help me for the same
 Service was quick, efficient.person was helpful with relevant information
 I think nothing comments . Also good.. .
 Because I think my problem was solved,will be sure only after a month Although I had to spend more than 2 hours at your store . I think it would be worthit if my problem gets resolved .
 If possible please revert back my connection to prepaid immediately
 Service was good waiting time was long
 Very good service provider is vodafone
 Very very disgusting very very bad experience team helpless fellows even store manager
 Completely dissatisfied I going to port my network Tq
 There are couple of reasons 1. There were 5 counter and out of that only 3 were working 2. Dedicated counter for people who want new connection, value existing customer
 Your contact centre calls with different billing plans and they don't inform that plans can be changed again only after 3 months which is a burden .
 Mansi agarwal was good nd was very helpful
 The store associate is very polite and intelligent too . No time waste . And store is clean, that's nice point I like !
 Very good performance... .
 1.Long waiting, 2.no seating arrangements for people in queue, 3. I have been allotted a used number, which was not told during allotment
 Superb service burrrraaaaa mza a gya voda office vich ajj ta muuuuaaaahhh
 Had visited whole day but ur Mr. Amit technical person not clear our net problem and had lost full day behind him and now he walk out from his duty .
 Dealing is poor once you become customer.did not get my bill neither hard copy nor e.mail for last three bills even after visiting the store a no . of tim
 I am not satishfied with the behaviour of mr . kaushik . he treat people like he is tiered from many day and also he talk to me with attitude .
 Company is changing policies everyday . This won't work out long for healthy business
 Good service
 My issue is about network i complain about six month ago but no action i complain it one month ago no action you care exe told me he didt knowwhat time it will took he realise the problem but unable to help me your office at peeragarhi told me to surrender the no if i donot got signel my office is situatet or transfer it to prepaid help me i am valuable customer thanks
 Good service
 Ownership change should be provided for prepaid customers . My sim's ownership is in my father's name . So I want to get him with me for every sim ossu
 U nsatisfied
 Vodafone Red associates were unwilling to take charge and help . They sent me to the postpaid section . The associate Sweta was most helpful
 Staff all around was very helpful and cooperativeHelped with a smile on their faceNever felt bad when same questions very asked twice or thrice . Went out of their to provide paper and pen.lovely service all around . Had a lovely experience .
 Even though there was rush at the store but when i got my turn it was quick and friendly advice that was helpful
 My work was done on given time, I am a student and I have learnt to appreciate time and I guess you guys do it far better than me !! Thanks
 yesterday i go to vodaphone store.for convert to my post paid sim to prepaid.. . but no budy to hear my problem.....it was rediclus... .
 For submitting new documents, they prefer new sim for old connection . but they haven't micro sim . its emberasing .
 Apparently all your services are too worst and bad. . Not satisfied with your services.. . I haven't found customer retention. . I feel phew been a customerof VODAFONE..please improve your services
 Generally service with smile what makes them different
 GOOD.BUT I WANT INFORMATION BEFORE YOU DISCONNECT MY MOBILE NUMBER.
 t could have been communicated that since stocks were not there, some other day would be better .  Thanks
 Firstly, your store is under-staffed for some time now .; five counters but only two manned . Your lady manager officiates on a third counter sometimes . The consequent coiling-up and ensuing delay is frustrating, especially on weekends . Secondly, the staff knowledge and response is disappointing . My phone 3G data link was restored readily . I then conveyed that whilst I had applied months ago to pay my bills through ECS, my bank the SBI did not accept it . Itherefore continue to pay dues personally on-line but Vodafone regularly continues to initite payment request and then inform me that the endeavour failed . I requested that this failed application be deleted from your automated billl recovery system to obvite this recurring irritant . He vaguely replied that 'let it be . It doesn't matter'.
 Very beutiful and i am very happy .
 Service is good
 The boy who is in the payment stand behaved badly, not serious

I generated token and wait for 45 minutes for taking my request . While i got my turn customer
 No person was there to assist me
 Good and happy feel service
 The store is always convenient to solve the issues related to the service . Your customer support helpline is useless . They give incorrect information about my account with Vodafone . They dint knew what was happening, unable to explain . I visited the Vodafone store and they understood whats wrong with my account and they resolved it . Your customer support helpline does not help at all . Thank you .
 for one form she tried thrice . Wasted lot of my time
 ining seemed to put them down .
 Inefficient & casual approach . store seems to be overstaffed with poor sense of responsibility . Had to visit store twice for same job .
 I want a no . Which have last 6 digit is 292929. I required a no with . ****292929 series . They gave me a no with ******2929 series in postpaid . but its have not n/k signal till now because back no . Of sim doesn't match.its a problm for me that today i will go back thair for start my sim .
 for portibility if u r dissatisfied with the services
 It was a gud experience in store
 I have received sms offers of rs 95 & rs 9 but your customer care & your store given different comments Now what should I do
 Interactive customer support. . thanks
 Good dealing
 Its was fantastic.. . Me too happy to come Vodafone's world... .
 No time for such luxuries
 Poor customer service to a more than 10 year experienced customer
 The executive was very helpful but since this months bill was exorbitant I was really shocked and he promptly send mail but I am yet to receive an answer
 A consistant smooth journey get relating to me. . Thank you All.. . Suprio Ghosh .
 Good response, Instant Service, Customer friendly, Network: Good Coverage, No False Deductions
 n't get such employee that easily, an extremely well behaved man with super communication skill, I wouldn't expect such a guy in a place like Vodafone store,although I have some major complains about Vodafone and it's processes, it's not worth mentioning about after having encountered with such a pleasantsurprise in the form of your this associate . A personal note to your associate -Thanks mate I really appreciate your effort yesterday . You doing a greatjob . A person like you restores my faith to the ****** service industry, as long as any company has an employee like you they won't loose business in India . It was indeed a pleasant surprise for me in the form of your help otherwise I was really frustrated with VF and it's some real meaningless process in place, I'm sure you know what process I'm talking about i.e, not recognising ICICI banks salary account statement letter as an address proof . Explain VF with your skills that why it can be accepted . You know what ! next time I'm visiting my bank I'm gona challenge them about why they are useless for address proof, however as you're just following VF's process, no complains about your help . Keep up your good job, thank you .
 Its excellent experiance with vodafone in this 2 months . thank you for ur services . and hope to will have the great offers ahead .
 executive Kajal is so helpfull and she had full knowledge about products..i appriciate her.all the best kajal fr ur future .
 No like Vodafone

 Good experience
 Receiving is good Satisfactory resolvence
 I was waited 25 minutes due to 2-3 counter vacant . After waiting associate resolved my issue quickly that why I had given 9 for 2nd and 3rd questions.. .
 Executives sometimes do not know and are inexperienced . Which leads to them trying to say it is not possible . Process needs to be streamlined much more.Make it simple, seamless . User friendly, which it is not currently .
 It was just good
 Im satisfied with your vodaphone store and store associate.He cleared my doubts .
 Long waiting time, first time complaint was not even lodged in system , next day it was said since first day nothing was lodged they will ne lodging today and den get back to me promised within a 48 hr call back which never came . Again on visiting they said they cannot process as the complain was nit approved . This was after a gap of 7 days . After lot of request they provided a form which they refused to submit as xerox mc of the ofc was not working and
 ame.. . and my active no has been blocked . And even after all this and visiting Vodafone store I've not received the due call from Vodafone Care .
 Good experience overall . Person that attended to us was very polite
 ofessionalism . He solved my all queries even due to his offer only I ported one my Airtel number to Vodafone .
 I am happy with your service so far
 They were prompt in attending to all my queries . Had good knowledge of their system and could guide me best :)
 Your service is very good, there are no question about it . But some of your store assosiates not even concern about the problem of customer . So, I have arequest to you that please make sure that every store assosiate are accustomed with your tag line "We are happy to help you" .
 Let the people sitting there be knowledgeable . They don't know anything about the matters they handle .
 Executive is very helpful and very skillful.best store i have ever visited .
 There is very less waiting space , other than that every thing is good
 Unable to furnish complete information about my complaint
 I wanted to pay my mobile bill but system was not working
 n0thing w0rthful t0 say
 i was given wrong information and i m upset with that
 Tedious procedures, tardy service, poor staff displaying lack of knowledge and initiative .
 ged extra for the plan change . Absolute **** .
 I am a costumer of yours, I think Vodafone have not need any costumers more .
 one of them asked to come back after 7 days ... . Really ? We would not be in this country ! So on the end we lost precious time and could not even get simple basic changes done that would have helped us pay and you retain a customer even though as pre-pay customer rather than losing altogether .
 I repy earliear thirdclass and mannerless staff I am most older customer of yor company he said so what
 Happy
 Response is good...so improve more than wat now u r doing against customers . Needs
 I want to change my no . 9811323961 From postpaid to prepaid because i have 4 postpaid no . So i can't affort . I have taken the request no . From customerBut no body can change the reason that your no . Have minimun 3 month after that u can changed . My question is why the request no . Provide to me if not happen before 3 months... .
 ters were left unmanned, causing me to wait for close to 15 minutes before I got to talk to the executive .
 I wants leave your service
 Wrong feedback on queries by customer care and store executive . Mahipalpur unit stinks of stale air . Very curt behavior .
 Awsum experience
 I got all information . Associate replied with very polite and passion . Rush was light so getting turn fast .
 Good service
 Everytime i go at store i get best service .. .
 Quick service with face to face conduct with smiled face
 I am satisfied with assitance in vodafone store and with ur service & offers in prepaid sim .,I'm using vodafone sim since7 year .,i have 25-30 vodafone user in my own family..But i'm not satisfied with ur service in postpaid specialy for plans offers. .
 i am highly thankful to that person i had visited in the vodafone store.thanks a lot
 My issue handled very well and resolved quickly
 resentative .
 I wanted to transfer my wife's mobile number in my name and had submitted all the required documents, which have been misplaced by your staff .
 My reason for store visit was value added service(mydala) inappropriately deducting inr 99 from my balance .PANKAJ in store understood the issue and i dont have to reiterate myself . Hence i am happy that i got the right customer care in store and he directed me to the person who can help me next and helpher understand the issue as well .
 Store manager as wel Reprsntatv were very polite courteous prompt n helpful .
 Bad reply from your executive and no proper information about my querry .
 I'm satisfied with answers given by the Store Representative but the solution to billing for internet downloads are not acceptable . I should have given the rating 0. Since the representative helped me understanding the issue..so 4 points is given for Q3. Need vodafone to fix the back screen downloads .
 For one sim exchange i visted 2 timese to vodafone store n one 5 months back i given complaint about network problem but i dident got any help after so many days i thought to change my sim to solve my problem so i my solve my problem my self only thats y i dosent like ur help line . an now they have changeorrect right now totaly ur vodafone care is not good

 Wrost experience...i m not satisfied .
 From 2days I m trying to get internet on my no . n still I m struggling. .
 The executive does not care, i wanted nano sim, he said my systems shows micro sim so u will get micro . He said he dont know much. . Very pathetic and looses temper . Though his manager mr . syed was amazin
 Good services they give me thank u so munch
 Quick service and courteous staff . Especially floor manager Ms. Pooja .

 se staff Q3: Interaction with associates is very good and giving full solutions .
 People at least should be at there seat . D.C.Thakur Torrent Oncology
 I've this number from last 10-11 years . I ported from airtel to vodafone in 2011 to have better quality of services . I recommend this number to be takenas my corporate number in 2011. Now in nov,14, I have been transferred to vadodara office and company has allotted me new local number there . Now I wantthis number to be my personal prepaid number so that I can keep this number with me in gujarat circle .
 My purpose was not served . Answer to every question was have a token and wait .
 One man come to your store from very far to his house in emergency and he's heard sorry there is no any solution.This is not fair
 The associate was prompt and responsive with the issue
 Nathing question and your rating is high
 I hv mailed the incidence at corporste.assist@vodafone from my email dhirajsbh@gmail.com
 Everything was good .
 Action on my request not yet initiated which is a loss to me. .
 rminate their services . At present there is no supervision .
 VERY GOOD SERVICE & VERY FAST SERVICE.
 Well organised,trained excevutives
 Many time there is a delay in provision of services and there is lack of communication skills
 Very good service .
 No solutions to my queries . I wanted to discuss more but the associate told the things he was aware of and said thank you so as to instruct me to leavethe counter .
 It's really good experience
 Well services
 No
 I requested for internet package and i have been provided wrong plan and even that plan has not been activated till time .
 Irresponsible disrespectfull discourtesy I can add on . No other means to contct superior authority ? Why ?
 The Vodafone store was totally unsupported and that said that if you had taken connection from my store I would have helped you
 The staff there is very Co- operative , helpful and polite
 The service is very good and helpfull....and excelent excutive...10
 Very good service..executive response is superp..i am very happy
 Had query about higher bill amount and she gave me solution for the same and I applied for higher data pack .
 I know u will appreciate my comments, but in my opinion it's of no use . Do u think people are so free that they visit your office to **** their time . Ofcourse NO.
 Though rushy, the services were good and efficient .
 during the visit to store I found that charging facility was not working also there was delay in attending customer even few associates where seating ideal . also found that after starting intraction associate kept me waiting for more than 20 min . even after asking to clearity in understanding my need andsolution provided
 I have visited the store to have my Reliance connection PORT to Vodafone every week for the past 1 month . I got assurances from various people, but no re

 Proper attendance guidance satisfactory conduct knowledgeable Mr Santosh
 Good Services
 but he and one another man is shouting me and start blaw blaw blaw they give me another request request number I.e . 760690546 but no solution.. .
 They treating a customer in good manner .
 It is consuming more time .
 No sitting arrangement ,long queue, time taken .
 It was really very bad .
 Your custmer service talking of them Problem solving is nice
 Very satisfied with Vodafone services fantastic network range all over the country exciting offers on call rates and data . Experience a very good journeywith Vodafone .
 Service staff is caring and fast
 Avoid ur calls if i give negative comments
 Your customer care Service no . (111) is worst ! Hence, had to visit the store frequently. . sent from my Panasonic Smartphone
 Cash counter had loads of people standing there
 Lack of proper communication
 My work been done within a notime .
 I brought my original pan card and passport copy to migrate from postpaid to prepaid but they asked me to bring my original passport who the hell will carry their passports in their pockets and the associates in that store OMG very irresponsive i asked them why i am getting this amount of bill and they said it would be like that and complaint whomever you wish and finally one thing we cant fight with company we will just migrate into another network sorryto say the facts Raja Reddy
 Lack of sitting arrangement and almost 45 min waiting time is very anxious . staffs were looking tired and delaying to attend the customers .
 Good service
 Nothing to say but some times network problems are there calls are disconnecting and are not able to hear the voice . Finally I'm happy with Vodafone
 I had some specific issues pertaining to change of address and tariff related issues . The same were addressed in my presence instead of telling me to come again and again
 Good
 Need appropriate solution for my credit limit without discontinue services....please call back to understand it .
 The associate tried to understand My concerns and acted accordingly.his attitude was helpful too .
 Well...my 3G services recently got disconnected due to non verification of address if which i got to know when i visited ur store, no msgs or call or ema
 Service & executive interaction was very good
 Shop is over crowded . For change of my tariffe plan more than 10 days . Few ameture staff.vfone is international company so need good training for staff .
 The executives are not proactive . The dont guide properly . Their replies are limited to only what we ask, they dont give information explicitly . Hence they make the entire experience at vodafne store inefficient . I had ro visit the store twice in 2 hours as first time they gave incomplete info .
 They were very helpful
 Because no 1 are responding properly..... .
 No body knows the answer to the problem neither customer care nor your center I bought Nokia 730 , where I get 2 gb 3g data free & also currently subscriber of 2g data plan Nobody knows how to activate 3g plan 1 great answer I got " it will automatically start after few days"
 you don't have voice unit price
 Store SERVICE EXPERIENCE in very nice very satisfied me . My broblem very likely svol Thank u Vodafone store... .
 Staff member's dealing v . Good .
 I am still waiting for the resolution for the matter I visited the service centre... .
 Excellant
 as charged 250 rupees, so basically I am not at all happy with Vodafone services .
 I was attended immidiately as I entered store & my SIM card was changed immidiately .i am happy as staff was courteous and was attended smoothly and politely . Thanks Vodafone and Mr.javed who attended me at Baner stores .
 I wanted to convrt my prepaid connection into postpaid in name of proprietorship firm but they were not having knowledge of approprite documents n were arguing with me
 Its overall good
 Asked for Skype settings . Did not get it
 store associate explained me me very nicely thanx to vodaphone to giving very good service in our area specially 3g service Thank u
 Fast services . But on your website it was mentioned that sim change is free but I was charged 25 rs
 Quick response from store associate,answering all my quaries to my satisfaction and he worked very professionally .
 i feel good experience from Vodafone executive thanks
 like dushyant at m2k rohini store who was acting like I can do anything I like and you can't do anything against me .
 Service is really good..and the executive is so helpful n sweet. .
 Fast and fluid service
 The reason I have rated my experience so good because . I was treated well at d outlet,the system is good n most of all the activation was done soon,I pray that this exprience will continue to be the same.God Bless have a good day .
 Very customer friendly set up and responsive staff .
 All are not expert to use your token system, somebody is essential to teach them . In current system customer feel , he is neglected .
 Every body was cooperative
 I felt it's quite Gud abt d service

 Very fine experience
 Too much of a chaos at the store . Relationship executives were speaking very loudly . Structural ambience is good but not maintained . Looked like a fish market .
 Good service and cre is best and most interesting knowledge my issue just 5 min closed this my isue data problem
 I am very happy with the prompt and excellent service provided by Mr. Ashwini at the South City Mall Vodafone store . He clearly stood out amongst all thestaff, by dint of his customer-friendly appoach, his thorough knowledge and a superior management skill .

 Service is very good and way of interaction with your customer is super .
 replying properly about which token no . is running
 Satisfied.. .
 Ha ha ha;-);-);-)
 Firstly the store looks like a fish market . Secondly the eye wash of token number is pathetic. . My token was 96 and 98 was attended half an hour before me. . When asked they said sim replacement is given preference on two counter out of 7 counters. . One was empty. .
 Mr.Naveen is very coprative person He helps me as he could did
 Good
 Very good. .
 Associate was very cooperative . Very good and satisfactory response .
 I'm your clients since 15 years . I have no complaints . Vodafone is always a good experience .
 While converting from prepaid to postpaid. . The interaction with us is so excellent. . However when we want to convert to prepaid again from postpaid, thekind of treatment we get is very much horrible. .
 Pls make arrangements for customers to sit . Wait time was high .
 Good help for store person
 it was good . they gave me card urgently . i was happy
 2g main 3kbps speed di h aapne aur apke agents jhut bolte h
 Good work knowledge,well behave staff
 Your store assistances are very cooperative . But I'm very disappointed with service and your customer care executive .
 First of all they didn't know the postpaid packages . I wanted to change my blackberry package into other suitable package . Later they realised that Vodafone red packages cannot be applied instantly as it requires approval from some top office . Lastly I needed nano sim for my new phone n when they took all the documents they gave me micro sim .
 Good. .
 executive can go through my voice and data plans and let me know the new and best plan which I can opt It will help me to decide best plan for myself andces are excellent
 Vodafone has Gandu ntwork
 Am waiting in store 45 min . But my coupon no.doesn't ask.finally I level the store. .
 There r many reasons . 1 I opted to port my number from reliance cdma prepaid to vodafone prepaid but 10 days are over and nothing happend
 I was Bitter experience In last visite to Garia more vodafone store !
 Overall the service is good

 If every family member is using voda sim only, than what u have special package for tham . Like i have five sim of vodaphone in my family . Hoping for fruitful reply .
 Service- good, bill charge - poor

 The waiting time is more for no reason,even when there are only a few waiting .precise and faster disposal is essential.customers have better things to dothan waiting at the store .
 No responce and wait for half and hours and my bill 99 Rd deduct for download . Charge but not clarify properly So I will change over to next any good networking
 First follow the first come first Service

 Store associate was not customer friendly
 All the staff at the store were very helpful and positive

 The reason I have entered to Vodafone store is not closed

 heir behaviour .
 The staff were courteous, polite and willing to help . I needed to spend only 10 to 15 minutes max for the service request to be completed .

 I going to put a mail to TRAI and ministry of telecommunications . Pls wait see.. .
 Great customer experience and hospitality at Vodafone store .
 Plz take some more chair .
 Have been running over the same issue for the past one month and it has gone nowhere . Didn't appreciate the respect for a consumers concern who had beenwith the same service for the past 6 years . Seems like had been fooled .
 The queuing procedure outside the store, at store opening times is flawed and not well managed .
 Customer friendly . Quick response . Keep it up .
 My work has been done immediately, and good response
 You guys have never resolved my issue from past 1 year . I had to loose close to Rs 30,000
 V good response from your executive, very helpful and intelligent,solved my problem. .
 VERY GOOD
 The interaction was pretty good and costumer service was very nice . Nice way of explaining about the processes . And within time given service was provided .
 Nice people,
 The manager ***** he is not the right guy at this position
 Only because of ur associate Azar and the security guard, I felt very satisfied and nothing else apart from them . Thank you
 One of the worst service i have seen . Rough speaking with customer . I have decided to port my 4 connection to other service provider . And also recomand others to port to other service provider .
 Liars. . I visited 7 times without a single mistake of mine.. . N nobody was cooperative with me .. I tried 7 times to solve my issue but they were like. .
 I had to wait almost 1 hour to talk to a customer care executive after taking a token . The executive could've been more friendly in his approach .
 Good response
 Wrong charge in bill not reversed . Making a fool of your customers by playing with words .
 None
 Ok thank you
 Your staff are very helpful And solve my problems quickly
 Educate all store employees about how to value customer and thier time .
 Please stop prompting me for Bill Payment before every call . Otherwise,everything else is Okay...that is,satisfactory .
 I AM USING POSTPAID VODAFONE RED 499 PLAN WHICH INCLUDES 1000MINUTER BOTH STD/LOCAL AND MSG BUT DOCOMO IS PROVIDING 1400 STD/LOCAL MINUTES IN SAME AMOUNT. CAN U PROVIDE ME SAME.
 Didn't give proper explanation as to why my plan didn't get activated....Staff is not trained...staff is very rude....Vodafone staff entirely is egoisticnd is not customer centric.....continuing with Vodafone is not my choice...pathetic service in store as well as over the phone....Vodafone services outside india is much better....I know this feedback is of gonna b no use...It won't hve impact on the wrost service I receive. .
 1) when I complained in customer care,they suggest me to go Vodafone store . When I go to Vodafone store they are telling like they don't have information.. . 2) There is some offers provided by Vodafone on Nokia mobile, when I asked in store they are telling like they don't know.. . 3) Some customer personis calling and telling lie like issue is resolved, when I call back new persons is picking the call and asking the same question again & giving the falseassurances.. . List is very long,I don't have to write everything here . Simply it's worst service & network both. .
 My prob re unexpected and undue charge for clicking My Delights was buck-passed .
 No commitment Only cheating to client Its got irritatating to me now selecting Vodafone .
 bove but 1 gb 3g instead of 500 mb in 249 plan . 5) i made my mind ok however in this plan rep in store was not able to find any internet plan wid this an00 mb 3g data and one voda nmbr free for 3 months wot i have not got . 4) on confirmation col repl told me that plan is for 249 and i suppose to get all a3) i have been told in plan 199 i suppose to get 600 local national mins + 300 local national msgs after that local col 30 p/min std col 50 p/min Plus 5vated today through MNP 1) the girl who told the plan was lied 2) the rep did not deliver right info however raised a complaint for me that i appreciate .
 Yeah the overall service and politeness of staff is good, but sometimes i felt that the bill is bit on the higher side anyway i am satisfied with the service till now and as i am using vodafone for a long time a soft corner developed and also recommend friends to use vodafone telecom services .
 Nice service
 Very worst and pathetic .. .
 Pls give respect to customer. . U giving a casualties only. . Plz change that
 I am not 100% satisfied coz the verification process in Vodafone is not good..they have taken more than 20 days to verify my numbers (9999343305 & 9999445082). I hope it's starts soon . Also My personal number which I am using since last 6 yrs is not allowed to me converted to a postpaid number dunno forwhat reason . Please help if possible .
 Your service is good...but you have to improve it..also you can give fast processing for complaints and queries. .
 Very excellent
 it was great to visit store
 Token system was not working . Long wait time . Poor customer service .
 an unpleasant experience . Please get in touch with me soon to resolve and know more about the issue .
 Ur Vodafone rep n supervisor malad r not approachable very bad service never expected such a service being a postpaid customer for 8yrs will port out soon from voadafone . Not helpful was charged for unbilled which never used was charged for itemised bill which was not notified from 7yrs . I made the rightdecision n will never recommend my friends n relatives to voadafone india .
 The store associate Mr. Harish is a nice friendly and helping nature person.. .
 Met the store manger got the job done as fast as I was expecting
 .. . sorry for using abbreviations,if any
 I have issues with Vodafone network..with the net getting off and all. . But as I got the new Sim nw..I.need to check and then rate.. .
 Overall good experience
 .wch is not resolved yet..the store executive gave me time till 14 the Dec..if it is not happening then I will think over changing the carrier
 It's excellent!! !
 Very bad customer service, very rude behaviour, had to wait for 2 hours for solving a simple query .
 I changed my Blackberry mobile to a higher model - retaining the same sim and number . The internet stopped working thereafter and the status is same till now .
 Best . If any quary/Problem arises solve immediately & satisfy us .
 I have got my SIM replace but I am not able to access me internet via my phone . I would have portable my number with some other operator for better connectivity.Almost 2-3 weeks passed I have not been able to recieve any 2G or 3G connectivity and I dont know the reason for the same.I wil just wait for 2-3
 Chirag is a nice champ . The job which took millions of email and conversation took a sec to sort out by handsome gentleman . He deserve recognition .
 Waiting time was long
 Vodafone all customer care people n branches are cheaters, 3times wrongly forged bill heavy amount, when visited gives false commitment and give **** stairs to customer by neglection
 Excellent! ! Really good experience ! ! And satisfactory service ! ! Ms. Daxa has done good job . I appreciate her work . Thanks .
 Hi , if I used your service. . I also agreed my services which I used for my postpaid number 9561713171.. but u hv to give waiver on me that number.. . dueto ununderstand uses. . plz arrange me waiver so I will go with continue with Vodafone otherwise I will port idea best cell service ... .  Thank you Callme on 7798671968
 So good
 The rating starts with zero coz the network vodafone is providing is really bad i have complaint about it before as well but nothing has improved . With such nad network i cant understand how a bill of 2000 is generated with a 2G netwotk whereas the record of my bill till date always less thn 1000. The managers are good but the service provider is bad which gives me a second though of changing the port .
 Good service
 Good services and employes
 Would help if waiting time is less
 On November 12 i requested a change of address which was not done properly n my address was not updated as the last agent made some error on the system nonly updated my new address for verification but didnt changed it properly so my bills kept on going to old address . I had to again go to get it rectified and when i said what happened no one bother to even say a sorry..bad customer service . Terrible is the word .
 Excellent service ever . Proud to b Vodafone customer
 Late service, rude behaviour of the staff,
 None of ur store member was polite with customer . Only one was working properly rest all were wasting there as well as customers time . Especially femaleassociates . I am also working female i knw hw mch time wil some1 should spend on 1 query . They shud knw hw 2 handle work load .
 Good response, fast action
 Staff was humble & I was offered a cup of tea
 apni problem battsie to waha bhi meri problems ka hall nhi huwa
 When u people force to take postpaid from pre paid it will activated in half an hour when we go back to pre paid it will take one week and this is the third time visit in store they r not keeping prepaid cards gandhi bazar store bangalore shame its
 The behavior of the representative was very rude and adamant...he was as if he was the king and we were meant to only follow him
 The interaction was quiet impressive...but however the services or the help provied by the administration dept . was nt that good...so do improve that...! !
 Today's meet with your associate is GOOD,but my visit with your associate at phoolbagan store is worst,because he give me false knowledge about your company's talk plans
 Excellent service I have got from executive Mr.Saptarshi .
 That was d 1st d I visit vod
 1. I waited more than an hour at store . 2. I went to store 2 times for the same reason . Looks like no one Is taking responsibility and accountability 3.I took the data plan but they did not activate so disconnected outgoing calls and asked me to pay the bill . This is really really bad
 Happy with the experience and really glad with the staff who handled the query well love you
 Very rude behviour by executive PRATIK with very limited knowledge of procedures
 The staff were around all though unwilling to attend the counters . Also a customer who entered after me and had a token number after mine was accepted first while I had to wait for a turn after him which lead me to getting late to work I had to spent half an hour before I could get done and walk out
 I went to confirm my payment which I made on 3rd(my due date) . They didn't update the payment previously . As a result I'm getting SMS as well as calls from Vodafone for payment which I have done . But the people sitting there was helpful enough to sort out the problem . That's it . Thanks .
 Mai bhut neerash hoo.mere complent krne ke bad bhi mera I.V.R. Nahi khola gya hae .
 We are happy with the services provided to us by Vodafone .
 Good
 Additional balance cut case, i don't download any application like (nd tv, hello tv)he doesn't give respons

 The token system is good to avoid long question
 No response to complain, not any satisfied reason given by them,costumer care also blocked my no .
 me to give her 10 points in the review. . She didn't even knew how to oblige or to wish a client. .
 Call me just then I explained the reason
 Ur service is very good and ur store representative are very helping person thats why i m give highest rating
 Useless people in your store Very rude behaviour and less knowledge .
 They treat me with some hidden things & after mistake of your associate they were not ready to agree for them mistake
 Ten
 If my problem not solve in vodafone store, then where i need to go with my problem to solve .
 In My plan I was having free 1 GB of 2g data . Ur manager deactivated it from My plan . How he can do this ? He was not interested in retaining his old Customer .
 Overall good and satisfied
 The experiencnce was fantastic . But u can improve a lot by reducing waiting time . Many of the requests can be attended online . Try to identify the same .
 I really mean it and my experience in the site was very good
 Lack of knowledge of Vodafone's rules and regulations .
 Store staff was good, however equipments as photocopy machine was not working . Take required action for it .
 I got what i asked for .
 Crowded place,waiting lounge was insufficient.There must be a counter for queries only
 Good job!! !
 U dint refunded my money that is what ratings r down else they were up 8 or 9. Thanks
 It's good keep moving friends. . Compare with docomo the offers are minimum. . Can you give me any discounted offers on 3G services. . Thanking you..by Tamilvanan

 Good and responsible staff
 U shud solve every clients problems keeping them in loop . But ur staff is very cooperative
 Need the quick result on complain
 My phone number was alloted as a postpaid number to someone else and my services were dicarded although my number was fully functional before and it tookme 15 days and innumerable visits to your service center to get this problem fixed.I had to suffer for no fault of mine and i m highly disappointed withvodafone for this major fault .
 Jst coz of them my gprs service was barred . Nd i was not able to use net for almost more than 24 hrs
 Very good smile & greating
 Happy
 Quick service, friendly staff and well thought of process . Though I usually not use the store for problems I think I will start using the Vodafone store .
 There was a long waiting in queue because no enuf staff
 Awesome
 Vodafone service is average . But I happy because ur representative Mr.ajay is very helpful .
 Your customer care official did not explain to me how to activate net on my iPhone .
 Understanding the need and for quick solution
 I was attended within a short waiting and your store associate help to resolve my quarries at my satisfaction .
 I think u tk action on that
 Gud guidance For my problem . Gud customer service .
 I visited to get a micro SIM. But the stupid executive did not give it mentioning sim is registered with some others name . But I purchased it in my nameonly . I will PORT my no . To some other neywork

 Un responsible people in your store change your employer
 She is a very good and hard working girl . Her behaviour is very good .
 attended nicely ,it was enough for me
 I am a vodafone user since for the last 6-7 years . I have to go to some interior location Dalkanya near Okhalkanda where bsnl was only available option f0 according to usage,as I have not crossed the data limit,call limit & sms limit my bill should not be more than 250 plus 12.5% tax . I asked him whetherI'll get any refund from vodafone after the completion of the cycle if I pay the full bill at that time but he refused and told me to continue vodafone till 4th of January or pay the full amount of 1200. Please tell me what type of policy is this . An old user using this vodafone for 7 years now want to port the numver due to some urgency but he was told to pay amount 4 times higher to his bill . Please call me at 9759263630 to resolve this issue asap . 3 days before I paid 926 rupees bill so now I can pay 1200 bill only if you promise me to refund the rest of money after deduction at the completion of cycle .
 Actually from past 3 to 4 months i did not call customer care at all then how come i am getting these messages from your end i am not understanding really you people are disgusting.. .
 Exelent
 Representative was very helpful and helped me out to get exactly the plan benefits I needed .
 I have received good response from store executive with positive response
 8/10
 Good service in office but problem in miss cal alert
 I Think u have no accountbility about customers problem . We have no option other than ur support team . We can't complain about ur support team . Even somesupporter r not doing work honestly . If some one facing problem continuously then u should take it seriously like in my problem .
 What ever Vodafone did, it took 4 days to rectify my phone connection and in the process they changed my SIM card 4 times !
 Once I spend few time on the campus of Vodafone show room rather than spending more time it'll make me to feel proud I'm also Vodafone customer.Thanks .
 Executive was not aware of the correct procedure
 I'm using vodafone since last 6 years, but now all services become pathetic day by day in terms of network & all services and if talk about vodafone store, is very pathetic about employee availability on all counter and attitude and answer
 Fast response & good behavier .
 Helpful & nice
 They talking and grinding rude behaviour
 Good ambience , open space . ordinary looking efficient staff, upright sitting gets rid of laid back (lazy) expressions . FAIR - no hanky panky .
 When i clled service centre or visited the vodafone store....i impressed....my experience was fabulas...thnks for vodafone service
 Appreciate your service
 the service is becoming worst day by day . really Vodafone's class is going down day by day
 I had to wait for over 45 mins .. This place was over flowing with people .. Which is the case all the time . There was no place to stand let alone sit .. It was *** and was stinking with sweat smell of so many people standing and waiting .. It was a horrible experience ,I wish I don't have to visit it again
 To gain the well wishes and bleesings from customers ur services need more improvements
 the service was good and the person dealing with me Mr. arun was great
 you need information in detail then better to call and understand
 Very helpful associates . Resolved query as per my requirement Hemraj
 Very satisifed

 Comfort zone
 Beacuse of all the staff of your vodafone store is very healping and coperative nature so that i like
 I have waited for more than half an hour in that there were three shouting vodafone customer n their floor manager is unable to handle the situation
 Discipline
 The way the person dealt and easiness of process was amazing . I appreciate the service offered from vodafone.. . thanks
 The service was good n queries were meet up properly
 They solve my problem within few minuts .
 Hello - its been twice that my tariff plan is changed without notifying me . Above that my 3G was deactivated still charging me for it . Also when last time i complained for tariff plan change, they said the charges will be reversed . that did not happen . overall i feel the customer care dept is just for show . its good for nothing...sorry to be so blunt but i cannot bare the false promises anymore.. .
 e to customers . Please try to improve the service . Thanks .
 Way of talking was good . I was facing network problem he just checked my sim card & sugges to change it now problem has been solved . Execellent ... .
 Customers complains are more and Executive to attend the complaint are very less . Pls increase ur staff .
 I got full support
 Very rude and roughly attitude from your desk person . Not willing to do her duty nor sensitive for customer need
 The network is not proper . I had complained about it but they have not settled issues . I have recharged for 3g net pack but if I keep 3g network on its not working . I went to Vodafone store but didn't help. . not at all a good customer satisfaction from Vodafone . Worst network I have ever seen .
 A Willingness to understand the customer .
 Exellant keep it up for every customers
 Market survey about company image in mind of customer
 So good
 I notice that our Poonam chember and sadar store notice costumer is not valuable and not important
 Sorry I no read

 Charges of all is so high
 Respected as per my opinion speciialy l am appreciate you for yr good responce to custmr i am gives you 10 pts for that furthure futurealso contnu this service thanks for our suggestion
 Horrible service ,customer care un Professional
 I have been charged rs . 75 on 20/11/14 for a premium service that i have not activated or used . Again on 09/12/14 I have been charged Rs . 35 for a juiceup pack which have not activated or used . The store staff could give me proof of what i have done on my handset to be charged these amount and said it could be some pop up that appeared on my handset when accessing internet . They were only trying to justify that the charges are correct and i have activated the services . I have been usin an iphone for the last three years and am aware of what to access while using internet . I not happy as I have not evencompleted a month with Vodafone and have been charged for some ridiculous services which I have not activated or used . If this is how Vodafone treats its customers then I will be taking my service elsewhere .
 Not able to understand my requirements for international roaming for data and call even from my end charges were not a issue . I am concerned only for continuous connectivity in India .
 Excellent service and hospitality .
 Excellent service and hospitality .
 Keep it up .. .
 Executive way of explaining is superb . Thank for being very patient
 Network is very poor on my number .
 Totaly no response u r vodaphone showroom . Sorry i am going to change network . Thank u
 From last one month my internet is not working properly they at store are not bothered to get rectified that is the reason pl.help me short out the problem
 I am happy I got what i had requested for. . I wanted to move to Vodafone Red n i got that. . The associate at d store atleast explored options n got it done. . However at d Hyper City store they said NO upfront which isnt impressive. . Thank u. . Good job. . :-)
 Quick response
 It was my first visit to the main store. . An executive near the coupon machine helped me with the immediate help as I had very less time . The executive 'Mr. Gyan' who heard my problem was very patient and did the best he could in my favor for my another no . 9711235561. The only thing I felt was if he could hv taken little less time on the system . Thanks.. .
 The purpose of visit is not solved .
 Your token service is the worst because customers are more but the assistants are less in number
 005600650072007900200069006E00730065006C
 Your customer service is very slow
 No proper responce from ur end
 Employees take an xtra effort to d job...dey r very efficient and consumer friendly.. .

 Every employ in the store is good

 QUICK RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY FROM YOUR REPRASENT MR. CH. PRAVEEN KUMAR HE GIVEN GOOD SUGGESTIONS to choose suitable Plan for me .

 Unacceptable waiting period, app 1hr, no seating arrgt even for Sr Citizens .
 The way of treating customer & diverting customer to new plans instead of what they want
 Every thing is OK but unavailability of proper waiting space is a problem .
 Its good the way of giving offers is very likely
 Quick response and Professional approach

 requested to your personal at costumer care centre to change of plan i.e . Unlimited, they said YES but not happened . My plan is 899. The bill is coming around Rs 2400. Several issues are there, so that i am not happy with your service . Your costumer.....Nayak .
 We r always with vodafone great family.thanks
 My needs were identified and understood promptly . Finally the entire process was finished quickly .
 The lady who talked to me seemed to be new but she was good enough to inquire and explained to me about my 3G plan .
 Very nice and speed service.excellent.thanks to vodafone .
 Good service provided by agent there.. .
 sales assistant for the reason and he did not give me one . He said that the only way I could get my number back was to change to a Post Pay - what a sneaky marketing strategy you have . He did not explain the options well - I still have no idea how to pay or how much I will be paying . The staff in the store were tired, unmotivated and unhelpful . I then had to revisit the store 2 days later because my number still wasn't working . Amazingly it worked as soonas I walked into the shop . The lady I saw was the only redeeming part of my experience - she was polite, helpful and kind . But overall my experience wasappalling and if I am not happy with my Post Pay I will take my business away .
 Extremely fast and professional service
 I got my work done within expected time and the staff were courteous thank you
 ble to help . Any way thanks .
 POSTPAID CUSTOMER WHEN I HD MADE-UP MY MIND TO CONVERT TO PREPAID.
 The customer service lady attending to my billing related issue, was not concerned in helping with the matter and insisted on sending an email . She did not want to discuss the bill or talk plan or even look at the bill closely to understand where the problem was . I was asked to send an email because the p
 professionally though was very busy with others seeking his help for trpuble shooting .
 The generosity of the store manager kajori roy and her gratitude to make me understand my monthly bill was impeccable,much appreciated,keep on the good work ! Thank You

 Bad coverage while Roming not a good response from toll free
 Slow servces n poor performance of staff
 Time,No quick response from some employee
 Vodafone network is good, Reprenstatives are attentive and reflective, and overall "Quality has no other choice" .
 Tarif is affordable and the offers are attractive . Even y'day got a new connection for my son . Though its little bit conjested there is no loos of time.Store associate Ms.Lalitha is very cooperative and understand my requirements easily .

 I need half paisa per 1sec plan continuously . Voda gives this plan very rarely . I do nt wnt check the plans every month . Eg.tata docomo they have regularplan on 2sec/1paisa . We are nt much happy as there no consistent plan
 First of all we purchased our sim on Thursday 5:00 o'clock and the vodafone store executive said it would take 4:00 hours to activate . But it got activated on Friday 4:00 o'clock when we visited the vodafone store again and talked to them .
 I visit the store after many years now I found the services very satisfactory compared to my previous visit
 Promises made on service with no delivery
 Still my query is not resolved dey said dat i wll receive a call but still i havent received any call.. . really ****** off wid Vodafone service
 products and people .
 No comments
 Can not trust on conversation, because they never fulfilled
 Need little bit more improvement .
 within 20 minutes .
 Not at all customer-centric behaviour, poor-understanding or motivated misunderstanding of issues, deteriorating store infrastructure, hospitality quotient, discipline & quality of manpower . Promised certain delivery of services, delivery never happened in about 7-8 days . _XX<1_XX>
 Our Vodafone is quick &honest with beautiful .
 e as your customer care miscommunicated with me which I recorded during the complain over phone as a prove because if I didn't record it & your executivere 0 out of 10. But some other executive helped me to understand my problem and she said that she will send a mail against my problem to the customer carower for solving the internet problem & he was taking his lunch at 5:30 pm & continued up to 45 minutes ! 2nd the executive who was appointed for solvinFirst of all I had to wait for near about 2 hours . But my token no . was less than the others,they were given the priority as your store had only one manp
 Network is good
 good store.please give Fulltalktime on small recharge .
 The floor manager patiently listen to me and offered me good service . Am happy with Mr. Sushata's attitude and approach .
 It was good experience and the people are very friendly nature finally I love the nature
 Very systematic handling n service with Nikita who attended at store and relationships manager Lavita Moses were very effective and helpful .
 The executive at the gallery wasted time by claiming that mine is a corporate connection and I can't change . I've been paying bills and I don't like to be held to ransom when this is my personal connection . A corp super saver plan is my choice and I'm accountable for my payments, how is this a corp connection?? ?
 My queries were solved by the executive. .
 This time iam stasfied....I hope forther also.. .
 Very gud interactive people and gud office work at the same time easy to get all things what the customer need.... .
 No service nd other charge volume is high so customer problem
 Realy happy to help
 Not giving proper solutions .
 Good service and good network
 Good
 Your team of Store Associates are quite friendly, empathetic and genuinely interested in addressing the problems of Customers and go all out to get the issue resolved . They are humane in their approach than mechanical.This is from my experience of resolving my problems on different ocassions and observingtheir handling of others' issues while waiting @ your Stores .
 Vodafone has many plus points.it has excellent service system.it has excellent networking, excellent customer care service .
 Your associate are not even interested to talking with us .. At 4.30 they tell wait we have lunch time .. & start gossiping
 A good service provider better than all in india
 Long waiting time . Chaotic . Sometimes rude staff .
 Th
 The atmosphere is nice but ask the associates to keep tender change
 Good
 Product performance is poor . 2G is more or less **** . Tried so many plans; but bills keep on shooting
 The attendent was nice to talk cooperative n good

 I applied for live cricket coverage but reception is almost nil on my repeated request nothing is done and I am loosing rs7 per day for nothing
 Great attitude towards me by the associate handling my query and got immediate resolution to my problem .
 He satisfied me
 The response of your store associates were pathetic, no zeal to help not even a smile . As if they were tired of doing all this and I a sure they were not HAPPY TO HELP.
 Nothing as such .
 Reached the store at 7pm for a new sim card issue,they asked me to come the next day because they were closing down for the day, but apparently the shopcloses at 730pm.i had to argue with the Vodafone executive to take my request which he finally did . And asked for 100 inr service charge for which theywere not even giving a receipt . So likely is that they were just pocketing the money.horrible experience
 Helping Nature Employee and they good work for coustmor
 Sorry u hv mistaken my answer for yr Q1. As I'm happy I'ld recommend atleast one or even more . My ratings r based on the experience I had during my visit
 Good behave
 Staff was very helpful

 Vodafone always say that happy to help you . But in last week I have not seen this . I faced many problems to convert postpaid to prepaid
 Wow experience at store. . Really happy as a part of Vodafone . Vodafone rocks

 Would appreciate if the RM can call me to try and understand my problem otherwise there's no point I of creating relationship managers
 Very good customer service really happy to help
 I activated international roaming I was very happy to know that deposit was not required
 The process was much time consuming . I was cheated by the company and my query wasn't resolved in the customer care .
 Ensure that your showroom staff take a regulated break . I witnessed them beginning their work at 10 am and taking a break from 10-15 to 10-25 am all together, if I was their boss I would have sacked them then n there , we were seven customers stranded with our tokens in hand
 Very good service provaided by shivam mishra
 really very good service
 My experience was good..her behaviour was so polite..too good.m hpy wid my last visit
 The complaint must solved within time , your company dont care for time
 For my comments you can call me at any time I will explain all

 I have always been happy with Vodafone services . My query was also answered pretty soon
 Staff not equiped
 Aapa gaye se internet de setting karvan sare bolde sanu mai aande fer aaap gaye shubham ko jine bas 2min laye ta sade internet chala dita oh bhia bht chnga se thanku Vodafonega se thanku Vodafone
 I wanted to put my number in safe custody from 17th December . I was sent from one associate to another, then told to wait . Without checking with me my number was blocked immediately . When I pointed out the error it was reactivated after some time . Also when I converted my number from prepaid to post paidin November 14, I was told there would be no charge for safe custody, whereas this time I was told there would be a charge . This is inappropriate .
 Prompt service . Friendly help . Ridhima was gud
 Some persons were not fully awear or knowledgeable . ie International Roamimg queries ? Some organised formal trainig would go a longway in improving over
 sales . Overall a good experience .
 SERVICE GOOD
 The store attendent atented and listened the problem nicely and tried to do what she could
 Excellent.. . I m satisfied with your service

 As I am not satisfied with the replies given by the customer care, I have visited the store which is 25 kilo meters away from my home . But my problem isnot resolved in store also . I am using this network from last 7 years, but still the replies given by the Vodafone executives are not up to the satisfying level .
 The vodafone guys were very helpful and was clear enough to answer my queries . The overall service was good .
 They should help in a order whose customer visited
 Good service good brand
 Sandeep in Vodafone store is an asset to your company, great customer service provider .
 Very helpful & interactive response and service .

 I visited Vodafone store to solve a repetitive issue permanently as per suggestion of your customer care executive over phone at 198. Your executive at Vodafone store was unable to solve the issue on the spot although I cooperated fully with him by showing physical statements . At last he looked for the manager who was not available and he took my alternate number but till now nobody called me to inform that my concerns are over .
 Overall it was good, keep it up .
 Vodafone store visit is very nice and very happy sevice provid
 The rating speaks for itself I feel this question is not relevant

 Long waiting.no respect for serial # or priority number of senior citizen s

 Good and prompt service to the customer
 Unexpectedly, the internet on my phone was not working . It was a critical day for me to be in touch with several colleagues on an important project . I just could not do without having the internet, nor did I have any clue how to fix the problem . I went to your store, was served right away (there being less crowd at the time), the technical person courteously attended to me, and within minutes my problem was solved ! I was out of the store in practically no time and was able to reach for a critical meeting in time . All in all, it was a very positive experience .
 All my queries were resolved and I was informed of the prevailing plans and the costs associated .

 Best experience
 This is not fair. .
 The servise is very good
 by Vodafone twice and even after so much of efforts they could not reverse fully . My overall experience is so disappointing with Vodafone . Sorry to sayI am very much dissatisfied with my previous experience with Vodafone when I was having Postpaid connection . There was much unauthorised Billing was made
 They don't care of customers problems.reply like unauthorised person
 Pls train your staff .
 Good, but we expect more offers from you for voice, data and sms .
 I am happy with service of vodafone
 Superb

 oftware of course; answered my queries quickly and thankfully I didnt have to stay in that store for any longer . Dr. Akshita .
 Plz maintain the network fully every were and plz give the offers as requestd by the customer or else the custumer will not stay in this network including me
 The rep was courteous and answered my questions, but the issue was not resolved to my satisfaction . The problem is not with the store, but with your systems .

 Vodafone store gonda , all employing is very 3rd grade and cheap
 Awesome with Vodafone
 Rude staff . Not helpful, I left without even getting my issue resolved .
 Your executives don't know how to solve a clients issue . This is not an HR limitation but an organization communications problem . In comparison, the anAirtel . I currently have 3 Vodafone mobiles in my family and only 1 Airtel mobile and Landline .
 your store associates are helpful & doing their work very fast
 Good service.. . keep it up .
 The services are good in the store, but for such a big store vehicle parking is very poor .
 All thimg is very but ,..there is no priority of time
 We are highly satisfied with your staff .
 I did not get my 50 rupees recharg
 Good experience
 Free
 Pls provide 64 k simcard to prepaid customers otherwise mnp is new option bcoz airtel n mtnl provide this typ sim to prepaid customers

 Good
 Ve ry helpful for an disabled person .
 I will switch off my vodafone connection as soon as poSsible. .
 Gud and helpul staff everytime a best service
 Service is good
 1. To take a number slip it took approx 10 min The person was not available neither watchman allow us to do ourself . 2.staff was sitting idle but couldn't take because of no slip 3. Than as usual ,as soon as no slip issued to at a time ten customers,there was rush which your staff was not able to handle.Very small but imp thing .
 It's good
 Still service can b improved
 No better offers and no store availability .. .
 Very friendly
 It was a good experience with vodafone .
 Excellent service, helped me get my job done quickly !
 My problem is not resolved
 I had asked for itemized bill but still they send me same duplicate Bill again .  Complete waste of my time .
 Good service overall . Executive was polite and made everything very easy for me . Your should give him pay raise ;) . 10 rating for him as well .
 I Am Very Satisfied

 Good working for all
 The women who assisted me at the store in viman nagar Pune.. . Came by herself asking if I needed help
 if customer service is not good then no one stay with Vodafone . Faced similar issue two weeks back and disconnected one postpaid number -9884879555
 Average
 ne which is so long
 The organization of Vodafone store is very poor .
 The store associates are not bothered to do their job which is cater to customers needs . They give a feeling that they were forced to do this job .
 1) Lazy peon staff,Extremely slow system . And too much ambiguous process and documentation . 2) Too much time consuming fr simple work .
 Issues are neglected . No on time solutions . Terms explained are not people friendly . I m planning to change service provider
 Too much attitude the staff has .. n there is noone supervising the staff. . n the service is too slow ..
 Representative was inexperienced & Vodafone plans offered did not met my expectations
 Very helpfull..explnd everything abt the plan and benefits. .
 Ur service is totally unacceptable . .. . i m going to change your service
 Very helpful and dynamic customer care executive, Ms. Shilpa Pradhan .
 It is highly disastrous to know ppl in Vodaphone store are not even knowing the basic etiquettes . Really shocking.very sad .
 It takes hell lot of time to wait n finally get ur turn though the associates r quick .
 Sensible staff and prompt service .
 Sir,their is complete mismangement,no proper communication,no proper guide lines, untrained staff,except mr . Aajeetesh Thakre . Most of staff is lazy,except mr Aajeetesh,Mr Aajeetesh is best of all staff,he should be on desk,but doing cashier job,even though he is on cash,he was giving correct informationto customer .
 Great job with good service thank you for ur help kavita
 always fighting with their collegues and also behaving rudely with the customers and not at all listening to the customers
 The store associate is very much helpful . He understood my issue & tried his level best to solve my issue . :)

 Kindly give some training to your staff and repair your computers and token machines and also tell to staff behave like a gentlemen and don't make your store like fish market and don't provide other Customer information to Unknow person .
 U guys come out of this question answers stuff. .   Wanna know call... .   If I dont get proper service.. . I will switch to some other service provider .
 not worried .
 There was hardly any interaction with your executive, also it took me more than half n hour to get duplicate sim minus 10 mins waiting time and i was told duplicate sim cost 100 rs . No suggestive selling or i wasnt asked for wheather i want mpesa service or not . The backend work was done infront of mewhile i had got duplicate sim in my hand but still i was looking at their faces when will they let me go . Sorry to say other operators hardly take 5 minile atleast.utes and cost is 25 rs where as i was told 100 with mpesa . I said no i took sim for 25 rs only now do not add 100 rs in my bill . And tell your cce to sm
 The system of attending to customers is fine . But the personnel are too few . Access on computers for them is limited . Every time its minimum ONE Hour Wait before someone attends to you .
 the vodfone(company) itself should make a surprise call on 198 for any complaints be it balance deduction or anything else and just hear pathetic replye complaints.actually I want a survey to be made from ur side to check the rude behaviour of their personnel and probably there must be a system whereinFirst of all these call executive don't accept any complaints from the customers.either it may be due to lack of knowledge or lack of authority to handl
 You're nice service
 The first question about recommendation is worth saying.i have recommend vodafone because of its flawless network providing,the honest transactions of billing and overall its good will since it hadbeen launched but when i have made the postpaid,i had to irritate.thats why 8.
 The peoples who work there,their behaviour ,hospitality was really good.They gave me good responce for all my quries.Thank you.gudnite
 Sorry my dear friend, I do not have more time .
 You did nothing
 You people are harassing me..... .
 It is sad that fr 1st 4 Qs are chargeable but not the last.We arebhonest and expect the same from the service provider .
 poor customer service executive
 Your store helpline is best. . !!
 1.in vodafone store there is no order wise to meet the customer . 2.after the customer reaction store people gets intract with them . 3.regarding my question they could not clarify my doubt . 4.what the customer need they don't provide them,then what the use of asking help form the store .
 n i asked for the reason, dint got the satisfactory answer .
 My internet promo pack not activet.if prosibel please activet my internet pack.thank u.and sorry to say,i am very dissatisfied .

 It was a very good experience. . All my queries are resolved. .
 Best network Ganesh
 I have making this request time again over last 1 yr to Vodafone that I will always like get hard copy bills 5 days at least in advance, but all in vain .
 Waiting time of arnd 30mins was pathatic . Then discussion at some desk and then payment at another desk is irritating . It has to be one stop solution
 The environment the grooming of all the executives n the knowledge about products was awesome
 problem immediately . . There is some or the other problem every time .. stop cheating the customer .
 I am very glad to part of the service in store and also i get good experience at the presence of service thank you and continue the same to every one
 When i came for connection all u r staff was very kind now not even satisfactory
 I am trying you contact your customer care for last 1 week, but couldn't . And of course, this is not happen with your network for 1st time . Hence I divided to move to other network .
 Store associates were very co -operative
 They understand our problems and solve with in a while. . one problem is still pending regarding poor signals at my residence .. ur representive stated that is under process to solve. . its ok
 Extraordinarily support with the best services ever
 :-D  And I never met like her I am loving her so much
 Sir,I went to voda store at Mahipalpur for convert my existing no to CUG but your rep misguide me and give me a another no as CUG and said that your exise a serving cert from me and fill a form to convert my no to CUG. But now I observed that it was done only for chang the address . I have visited five orepersentatives like them
 Your executive attitude was ******** they wer illmanner not solving my problem in inspite of telling dem i ll leave vodafone their attitude was like ok you can go we dnt care and your internet service is **** all and bulshit soon i will b porting to airtel and do hell with you . Your service is ******** and also your employees and also i will tell all my frnds and relative to change over to airtel and will go to consumer court and sue vodafone for mental nphysical harassment and lose of money and time do hell with you

 I have full support of your executive ms.gagandeep kaur. . She is very supportive. .
 Realy good environment in store. . Filling is like globally store wise. . best service provide for aall executive . In cbs store Realy they present the vodafone.. .
 Your store executive is highly disappointing .
 The information which were given were factual unlike call centre people
 They were not able to provide me a reason, why my data card was not funtioning correctly . They asked me to carry my LT to the store :-).. . where as the problem was with net connect and was identified the next day only .
 In my phone suddenly you charged for data usage whereas previously for the same usage you never charged me any thing extra . The gentleman in your officethough promised to get maximum refund which remains to be seen .
 Post paid facilities should be improvised with economical packages .
 I was out of store within five minutes completing my work satisfactorily .
 Super Customer service
 Good
 Keep knowledgeable n educated staff who are willing to work . Swapnil gave me incomplete n wrOng info for which i had to suffer a lot .
 Recruiting technically skill person and provide training with customers problem based and review
 No sitting place/ arrangement for waiting in queue after taking token, also miss commitment given about billing by marketing person while porting from lo
 T
 The waiting time is hilarious....please improve it. .
 Nothing to say, good experience . please keep continue in the same way . Thanx to vodafone care
 Based on the resolution provided by our team, how likely are you to recommend Vodafone, from 10 (very likely) to 0 (very unlikely) ?

 Thanks for nice service .
 From last 1 month i m trying to get my plan change . But not happened yet . Roming charges have also been charged to all my 5 numbers
 Associate are not well trend,they are just passing time ,when customer are in waiting with token .
 To renew plan I visited your store since no one could take responsibility in the absence of a gentleman I felt very bad & made me to visit today . WhichI have done today , my suggestion is to delegate to another senior official so that customers kept happy
 Good service
 It should not to cancel my documents after 5 months of activation and to tell me to issue the number with another documents . When tt was in my name .
 Good customer service at ascendas chennai branch
 I have rate that becoz I feel everything was missing there .I had waste my 55 min for small query . nothing care of customer, worst things was he don't k
 Applied for porting from airtel to vodafone on dec 1st but til now this has been done yet
 Currently my problem not solve as commitment problem solve with in 24 hours .
 Ur system is bad n meant only to cheat people . Ur people r stupid n dumb .
 Excellent comprehensive service .
 High cost data plans . No retention policy for premium customer . I am using same num since 11 years
 Prompt resolve of the issue
 Late approach sitting arrangements should b made for waiting customers
 The persons sitting in your Kothi store are totally rigid
 Excelent receiption and prompt service
 Non-cooperation,false commitment,
 Network service may be good but there is lack of transparency in billing as sudden change in itised bill being charged
 Now there's no problems at all
 The attendent could only answered the questions but could not give solution .
 I have purchased red plan of 1299 .while purchasing time customer representative from Vodafone center had told I can degrade & upgrade my plan according
 Vry satiafied
 I didn't ger an answer for my doubt . Can I have a word with you customer care executive
 Your associate Mr shubham doing the commandable job and always solve the problem of customer . Thanks
 All over service was appreciated
 You hv only one floor manager . Kindly hv a help desk to time manage a persons waiting timea
 I went there to get it all sorted out but i was provoked not to pay even single rupee , n let it be
 Right now I am sitting at ur same store yesterday I purchased a new prepaid no 8587992657 from here and was told it will take 4 hours to activate but till now it is not and I am told to wait further at least for half an hour
 Vodafone is getting to expensive day by day
 I gave full marks because ppl at ur store were gud accomodaive nd quick . But ur services r poor as it took many hours to activate my number with a merenew micro sim although my connection is so old . Then person at service centre could hv solve my problem by explaining to change settings for 3G.
 very good
 I demanded RED plan . Was told its not available for my no . And was offered things I didn't require . But I could get it from site . Why the cheating ? My bi
 I got all the help I wanted .
 I m useing vodafone service since 19 yrs but since last six months facing lot of prblms and when I visit d store it take minium 90 mins to sortout d things and no confrmation from manger even
 Sorry its too late, I had wrote a mail to my corp that i am changing the another mobil network .
 So much waiting time . Simple task took me 45 minutes .
 They do not solve my problem
 0 Very very Derty with badly system & store services
 Postpaid schemes are too expensive Also decrease the rates for 3g data .
 Things were quick and easy
 Not satisfied with the work of your executive at your Vodafone store .
 Service on vodafone store was very good . Really appreciate the staff . Really helpfull . Thanx fr such support .
 Actually as a matter of fact the security did help me out in making a payment in machine . I really appreciate that he was an amazing person .
 Overall experience was good but the staff need to be better informed .
 Staff does not have information regarding what call center has committed . Even manager is unable to correct the billing mistakes of Vodafone . Overcharging is your forte . store ac doesn't work . Need to wait for 1 hour every time but still problems are not solved
 The Worst Mobile-Company of the WORLD is Vodafone.. . *Himanshu.. .
 It was quite remarkable assistance i would say . Rather very satisfactory,appreciate it
 Very bed
 Best experiance and services . Never experiance such type of immediate service.. . THANKS.
 Good Service
 Excelent service
 I am a very senior citizen, 82 years old, and handicapped since I use a walkhng stick and have difficulty in standing even for 5 minutes . Your Stores Associate understood my problem and very promptly helped me and registered my complaint . I had gome to U S A on 17th September 2014 for 6 months and kep014, that is, after 2 months and 10 days, due to Medical Emergency . I wanted to know whether I can get REFUND for the period for which I did NOT keep my telephones in Safe Custody . Your Stores Associate helped me in this matter . I AM SURE VODAFONE WILL REFUND ME THE AMOUNT.

 CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE INFORMED ABOUT NEW ECONOMICAL PLANS.
 No proper response from Vijayanagar branch
 Good setup . Good officers .
 Your staff dosent know to speak or type proper english . Dosent have proper knowledge of plans offered to customer . I am afraid your service is degradingday by day and only brand loyal customers are still with you rest are porting out . Do something or shut the company .
 Found the Vodafone people most helpful especially with national roaming . However issue with phone is still working on 2G not 3G so will have to go back to Vodafone shop again this afternoon .
 I am very like to visit vodafone store
 8 interesting !
 t my no . Into prepaid they asked so many questions trying to make me use postpaid as if they were going to use my number and pay my bill.And later i found out that my number which i took in postpaid 2 months back out of compulsion(not by choice) was not compulsory at all.i lost my number 2 months back andwhen i went to take a new sim in this same number a store associate named Riya told me that i could not take prepaid so i was compelled to take the postn.I lost my trust in vodafone is really .
 because my 3g speed problem is still not solved and im irritated of vodafone and will transfer my no to another network
 d of giving time frame on resolution, promises broken, dare to get back to customer dare to speak
 It was over all very satisfactory . Ms. Trupti was excellent in her dealings with me .
 Good experience isanpur store
 Time taken to attend user is too high . Every time require 2 hours or more . Information provided while taking new connection was not correct . While takingnew connection they told that security money will be adjusted with final bill in time of disconnection . But when I have given request for disconnectionthey are telling that security money will be refunded via cheque after disconnection withing 45 days .
 Helpful
 There is always a scope for improvement .
 Your service is below the satisfaction level
 Good experience . . . . . .
 K
 Very good .
 I would appreciate a phone call to share my experience .
 The person attended did not exhibit any patience while listening to my problem .
 your Vodafone Executive Is FroDi ..and Lier ...South Ex Center .
 Pls activate my new plan ASAP
 Service got disrupted for 2 hours on 11dec bcoz of verification issues, where my verification had been done 4 days before . That was unacceptable from cus

 Executive was very helpful, with lots of patience and experience
 O
 VERY EXELLENCE VERY SATISFIED & VODAFONE STORE STAFF ALSO TO MUCH CO OPERATIVE & FRIENDLY WIDIN 5 MINUTES GIVE REPLY. I PREFFERED ALWAYS VODAFONE
 On the whole service is excellent
 1. I had paid my bill for Rs . 470 in cash at the store on 3-11-14 when due date was 5-11-14. They did not update it with Vodafone . This led to my connection being disconnected for 1 month . 2. I received nearly 18 calls from Vodafone as regards my bill payment . Inspite my giving every caller the details,they kept calling and asking if I had paid my bill . Sometimes at the most inopportune times . 3. I had to visit the Vodafone store twice to get my new simcard . 4. After getting my new sim I had to visit the store thrice to get it activated . Once they told me that the documents were not collected inspite my having given the documents one month back . 5. After that I visited the store again and was informed that it would start at 4 pm . It did not . 6. I keptgetting a message saying that call 117 to activate but when I dialled 117 it said Emergency Calls Only . 7. I had to visit the store totally 5 times to get the phone working . 8. Inspite my cell being barred for the month of November, I have been billed for it .
 I m nt happy with ur service buse lst 15 days i registered my no . Still it is nt activated ?? ?
 Helping & co operative sales executive
 Good staff and prompt services
 For change of address your store took 6 months . Further I haven't taken internet connection even though you have net charges and while complain the
 Store bahut achcha tha aur waha ka staff bahut helpfull tha
 Bill reciever conter slow
 Very very good experience store representative is too coperative and helpful
 If there r too many confusing schemes, patience n clarity is necessary to xplain us d same properly .
 Poor service
 Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to mention that any visit to your store should be for exceptional cases . Most of the solutions are such thther reason for going to your store is essentially for human interaction . Otherwise in this system-driven era we feel like talking to some machine . Thiscould be better handled by some dedicated team over phone . As regards the recent visit I got what I wanted . The rating is just a reflection of that .
 Your service is good Vodafone is no . 1
 Executive @ counter had no clue & called her male colleague to teach her . Uninterestedly she calls me by her side opened Vodafone website & told me where to look for IR. No smile, raising of eyebrow . I went @ 10.30 am @ Churchgate when there was no rush & working day just started
 Firstly peons were alert,secondly staff was interacting with clients,boys n girls both.thirdly I was attended by manager I think.fourthly he was professional as it took him no time to get job done .
 Ok not conveince with the ans
 In chandigarh 27 sector vodafone store ms . Poonam sharma has very good sense of talking and giving vry excellent service to me .
 The gentleman in counter listened to my problem with care nd proper attention nd offered a solution immediately . All of them are good in their disposionnd always willing to help . Only thing i dislike is the sitting arrangement is very poor, customer need a good sitting place .
 Hi , the gentleman was clear, but as I am a foreigner he was not able to understand exactly what I wanted .
 Good peoples

I hope vodafone authorities wake up and improve their customer relation before its too late.e than one hour and above all this the lady representative Miss Usha/ pushpa was very rude to say the least and she was only interested in reducing the cThe person at the counter,Mr ketan was at loss to explain me my basic tariff plan , the systems were not working as usual even after a wait period of mor
 The associates were not following the token numbers . A were spending much time in customers they were dealing with..and morever they left there seats androaming within the store . Centre manager was out of sight , so it was not possible to complain also..very horrible experience .
 Good response,and time save
 Very helpful executive
 They took my request easily I got convinced by the services they provided me but my query has not resolved so far I had given request for my plan changethat had not changed so far that is so the issue I have then now
 The store associates were wel behavd nd generous. .

 Later on
 The staff was very helpful while attending to my needs . And I could get my job done in the best possible manner n fast .
 It takes too much of a time
 Good
 My request remains uunresolved, Vodafone does not value customer .
 I have to go to Vodafone store preet Vihar Delhi every month to collect my monthly Bill since it has been converted to postpaid (May14). Every time I register complain but your people are low profile with tendancy to befool customers . Bill are not even mailed to my ID. I will sooner fax to Prime Ministeroffice as it has cost me a loss of thousand bugs . Regards
 I was happy with the response I got
 I have replaced my 8860526157 number from vodafone store C-53 RDC Ghaziabad,100 rs charged by them for this process while it has to be of 25 rs as i havetold by custmor care.....finally its not the matter of 75rs its of trust,its of custmors belief....that where should a custmor purchase the product if your stores misguides a custmor...if u can do anything then take a action soon.i have complaint for this too but i dont get any proper responce yet....mycomplain number is 2513735794.and my token number is 109 when i visited vodafone store at 03.26 pm .

 Everything was fine with the store . The store keeper was helpful but I din gt the any result for my query still
 Mr.Abhay is mot aware of any process when I insist him then he tried to find the reasons for my issue
 Very fast and reliable service . The staff was wel mannered and dedicated to work efficiently
 The waiting period is far too long - it takes an hour sometimes more, just to get a simple matter attended . The situation worsens when your link is downwhich brings everything to a standstill .
 Your store executive behaivour was too good .
 Because of I satisfied for my questions . So I gave 10 numbers
 Met Mr Lakshminath I told him what is the issue presently am facing then he cheked within 3 min and wen I came out of the store I got a message on resolution ty

 Good Service at Vodafone Kandivali w store...thanks.. .
 See I am using this Vodafone no.for the last so many years As coming from Japan I told them to start my internet for which I actually went to Vodafone office After waiting for long time they told me to deposit the amount and it will be activated in two hours But even after four hours it was not activated, then I called customer care they told me that they didn't receive any request, really I waisted my precious time Now planning to take BSNL connection may stop Vodafone which I was using for long time ******* really don't know the value of time
 In ur store no1 doesn't response properly for one reason they say u come tomorrow den after tomorrow if will keep on going like who will our work we haveto waste our time by going. . As well for ur executive have to wait 30 to 1hour coz they went outside u be seated please for small work we have to wait 1hour by wasting our time
 ypoint u shud care about it
 Good ambience and had a better customer service ! Also, Expect more proactiveness from the shop keepers to explain the customers expectations. .
 Ur staff is vry Co op & Polite &also Prompt
 den on me, nobody is giving help .
 I'm an old customer, I was never told while I changed my phone got the new plan activated from your store that blackberry services won't be available onthe new Z3 blackberry device still Vodafone charged me INR 890 each month while that plan wasn't working on my phone.. . I feel cheated
 Overall it was good experience . Only problem is there I have to wait almost 45 minutes
 Call me i will explain,

 ve to stand for 30 to 60 mnts .
 Coverage in our area is poor . And couldnt change my callertunes by any method... .
 Service & co-operation
 When taking the token, someone should stand there asking what exactly the case is, and what do you need to carry to do the same . I waited for an hour andwhen finally i went to the counter asking for a micro sim, she told me she needed the signature and id proof of the sim account holder(my father) . Again i went to the store with my dad and saw a man shouting at the attendants(some complaint) and the lady who i talked to before was attending this angry customer . So there i had to wait for 30 mins . And then she filled the sim exchange form and gave me a micro sim . So, No . It was not a very good experience .
 njustified bills having data usuage, which I have not done for last 3/4 mnths . I have already a data plan for my CUG Vodafone no . 9874222990. Planning tolv Vodafone .
 Were good comunication with cus over all plan expert in thert person .

 Pathetic services . Poor Network . Disgusting experience .
 Correctly resolve my problem and explain everything what I was needed .
 It's a great store . I like Vodafone billing and network both are very good . Ponda store has been my favorite .
 The place is in complete chaos, the coupon system is useless as tgey are taking any coupon at any time . There are only 2 associates for quaries . And theminimum time required for any quarry is 2 hours
 These store people are very much helpful and very informative . I had reliance post paid connection and I use to visit reliance store but it use to very
 Overall good expereince.all queries were handled nicely

Wen I reached there first of all minimum number of counters were only operational . I took token and I had to wait for around 1.30 hrs wen I spoke to your executive I was told ki don't convert to prepaid we will give u another gud plan which we give yo port out customers . I enquired abt the plan n okyed it .
 Staff is very helpful
 Executive behaviour and service was really good .
 I think vodafone 3G rate is very costly then bsnl 3G.its very mutch problem for evry voda customer .
 The advisor who give information have no full information about tariff plans...he asks from the other advisor
 I realized very bad experience at vodafone store
 Overall a good experience.Thanks .

 I am totally disappoint with billing . Now I m going to switch Vodafone and join other
 Some problems with setting up phone but staff were very helpful .
 Store associates and customer care and backend team dont have minimum knowledge of product and process and there is lack of communication between them everyone says different about process in their own ways and giving fake commitments at main stores too
 Long wait time without resolution to the issue . Total wastage of time . I am going to change service provider .
 U r already doing well. . No comments.. .
 Not satisfied with ur Internet speed in my area I just want to change portability and don't disturb again
 Very bad services
 I find Vodafone most professional than any other network providers . Just your live chat needs to speed up a little with better English grammar .
 Vodafone is very bed compney

 fone store so I can't check the system properly"
 The security at the entrance is cold in behaviour .  The staff members are not adequate . So many workstations were unmanned . The long waiting was nauseating and irritating . It is not enough only if you have a sophisticated building and interior decoration . It must have a human touch with a smile .
 I'm happy
 I would like to know the charge for sim replacement . From the store .
 Please change the store timings,very bad experience with timings
 Excellent service by the service associate
 After 3 visit and 5 calls to Vodafone store my sim is not activated .
 Excellent service provide by vodafone everytime, good interaction and always there for customers to help . Overall we have good experience and this is thereason all the family members have vodafone . Thank you
