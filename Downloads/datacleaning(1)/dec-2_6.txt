 My experiance about vodafone members are fully provided the response to the customers
 Your service is poor . There is no warmth . Very eagar to complete the transection .
 Very Gud service
 Efficient service with a smile and helpful .
 Vodafone is very much equipped and developed when compared to airtel or docomo or any other . The service was good in order I would say . And it's pretty decent in all .
 My problem is not solved yet.I think now i am porting my number as porting request has already been sent .
 Customer Service is good
 There was a long queue before the store associate could attend to me..I had to wait for 45 mins..2 out of 6 counters were not manned
 Got personal attention & job done immediately to my entire satisfaction
 em . I m using this number last 5 years but when i m any network or any problem they do not help me . Because this connection on my father name ... .
 I request customer agent to respond in a positive and in a happy manner not like replying angrily .
 Good
 Waste waiting period.for simple inquiry I take a token and after that 1 hours waiting then really disappointed reply
 The lady at the desk was very helpful
 My comments are so because in a Ahmedabad city at two different store of Vodafone I found SIM card cost different
 I was told ur problem will be sought out after going to vodafone store but even the person there was not aware of solution
 I had to wait even when I could see your staff not very occupied . Also, I visited the store 4 times to get my sim replaced plus I had called twice when Ihad already requested for a sim card last night . I was told my request has been processed and I'll receive it in 14 hours but I would not have called the other morning I would have never have come to know that my request was never processed . I had to waste my working day over the formalities to get a small sim replaced .
 I m harrisng from 2 months by Vodafone store
 Interaction is polite n really helpful
 very good service i got and way of handling and resolving is realy great
 Very nice
 Eagerness to help
 It was nice to visit.tat was low and interaction was gd .
 Overall experience poor . They made me wait for 30 min just to get answer that representative will call . In store there were 6 counters . Of which 4 officials were present . Of which only 2 were interacting . Other 2 were just passing time . I had registered a complaint at call centre . They advised me to go toith u all
 Overall interaction with executive was good however the only thing which was lacking, the token system . It was not working properly and people were conf

 Store associate properly got my problems and help me to choose the best plan for me .
 0....because you don't give true inputs to customers and try to make fool out of them....wake up....now time to approach your executive heads... .
 Overall satisfied
 Net service is of very inferior quality...comp to other comp.. .
 Communication gap . Long waiting .
 Very gud . Excelent respone.keep it up . Thanks to voda fone
 Excellent coordination with staff to solve custmer problem
 I am satisfy I am very happy . Thank Vodafone
 No budy have full knolage of your rentle plane
 STOTE manager and employees don't value customers time I waited for 30 mins for my turn and another 20 mins just to stop a service this is not acceptable
 That was a nice experience .
 The staff was very understanding, helpful, clear and prompt . Store layout was convenient . My purpose of visit was very speedily solved .
 Your service man dealing with customer with very politely and help on priority bases, really I am very happy of your service, I hope you will continue with this service . Thanks
 The cooling of the store was not up to the mark, aft that has been infromed to Singdha . She has misbehave and not attended my complain . That is not expec
 is reducing day by day , it would be better if resolved as soon as possible
 The atmosphere in the store is generally chaotic . Once you walk in you are clueless as to what to do as no one guides you . There are 6-7 desks but only2 are manned at any given time . I went at 10:00 when most of the morning should have arrived but they started trickling in around 10:20
 Nice interaction with customers
 in no hurry and patiently answered to all my queries .
 Knowledge is limited of the staff, they tend to push you to other people for simple queries also . The token machine was not working and few people who came after us were served before . The staff was very rude and did not even try to explain anything . We were extremely taken aback when we were asked if wewere literate .
 Change address verification agency
 Not bad towerage.....Not bad services.....Not bad tariffs..... .
 Great service . Continue doing the good work .
 In my experience Vodafone is s international fraud by having tie up with like mydala snd others . Without my consent how vodafone can debit my account forthird party service . It will be a serious issue one day vodafone will get caught .
 Kunal was efficient . He gave me clear & precise information . All questions I had was adequately answered by him . The person at the cash desk was also clear & helpful.The only thing I didn't appreciate is when I walked in there was a person at the counter to help me generate my ticket, who asked me what help I needed . When I told him I needed a Nanosim, he then asked me if I was carrying documents . His attitude was patronising and it seemed he was brusqueand patronising rather than genuinely enquiring . Given this is the first person I interacted with, it left me feeling annoyed and disrespected .
 asked the lady why she asked me to wait....and then she gives me the SIM, don't know from where . This was at Bellandur site r
 Overall experience was good
 The store associate have very pleasing mind and she helps to solve my issue i am very satisfied with the interaction between your assoiater ..she had more care against the customers.. . so i like your store sevises are veryy better
 Good
 No Comment
 This time ofcourse the waiting wasn't much as was given a priority token number but waiting has always been a killer .
 Staff were friendly and things were done without much waiting

 Politeness is less.High handedness is rampant.Care,attention and patience could be further ingrained .
 Poor service and poor commitment
 Store was not well organised . Not everyone needs a token number . There is mainly only one person who does all the job .
 Vodafone net package should be less then 100
 Good
 Overall the attitude of the store staff was good .

 Work done very smoothly and quickly
 My billing seems unapropriate . . .
 I think vodafone is not good . The cstomer care doesn't provide satisfactory informations . It is a very bad network provider . Vodafone deducts the account balance without any reasons . Vodafone exploits the customers . I invite my friends to port from vodafone to other networks with me . Thank you
 Ur staff in the store is very co operative ,energetic and helping so l am satisfied my work is done.Thank you

 He give me the proper answer/solution to me .
 nstructions from Vodaphone was inadequate and I suffered loss for two months and restored toy earlier plan as instructed tku
 at.I don't known where u people r not providing paper .in a service field I never seen such a treatments .
 The person present pretended to be busy . My need with the network is unfulfilled
 opening the pack .
 I liked the service, the interaction and the response time. . so i would recommend Vodafone .
 Good excellent
 This store is v friendly,parcticullary the person who attented me,he is v nice
 So good & Quick
 Your service is very bad at vodaphone gallery waiting is for more than one hour and after that the help desk people just anoy you by saying that the lasttime when visited our store the person who has handle your case is not working with vodaphone anymore he might given false promises sorry we can't helpthis my personal experienceA few days back your vodaphone store opposite Kokilaben hospital four bunglows
 Well I am a busy doctor and had to wait for 45 mins .. . Then the guy who had to take me .. . Just suddenly tells me to wait and takes a foreigner out of line.. . Then when I go .. . Treats me with in diffirence and not very helpful .. . The only reason you are getting anything above zero is because there wasone other guy who saw my plight and took me to his table and tried to help me ! .. . The first guy was surely not "happy to help"
 The reason is that i got different different information from different different survice executive regarding my query
 I got call they told me we ll call back u but no n my call rates which I made 30 or may be 35 paisa
 I had gone to enquire about international roaming. . They just handed me the pamphlet and said you can call the call centre - they will assist
 Please help me
 To help you to find any problems and increase customer satisfaction . Happy to help !
 They couldn't change my plan.. . it was like visiting govt office. . vodafone has lost customer friendly what it used to be earlier
 More open with your regulatory body because a change in my profile needs correction &nothing to relate with your store
 Mara no aabi tak chalu nahi huwa 2 har bola tha
 Despite debiting my a/c I wasn't given concessional rate.Msg of My plan details doesn't reflect v2v tariff . For a fortnight I'm going to be charged 1.5ps/sec since from morning till night no executive was available on dialling 198 &then 4
 V.nice service over all
 I was misinformed about a service the last time I came to the store and had to come again which was very inconvenient .
 Extremely satisfied with the service and response.. . As I made the request and with in one hour I got the solution
 U were courteous and helpful
 EXecutive dont behave profestionly
 I was guided well
 Good service
 I
 Nice arrangements but i think there should be more space & chairs for customers .
 Actually they don't know, what plans are running on my phone . Even after bill paid they didn't gave me single piece of paper of paid bill slip . When I ask . He said thad vodafone don't give them paper..huhhh...amazing..just very poor.. .
 The guy are very friendly n helpful and they really mean for you stand for happy to help your customers appreciate n i really say thanks for all the tramfor their lovely efforts give them a gold star
 Will send in the morning
 Nice... .
 Was that a store??? ? I don't see a single person who have entertained me . It was a collage kind of crowd . Every one is so busy with making himself count . I took an token and I have been waited for at least 10 minutes . Super poor standard . I ll change my league very soon I hope .
 Always try to understand and go an extra mile to help very valued customers . Scrapping off just 1500 rs is not a big loss for the company as long as thecustomer is giving good business to the company .
 Was very quick and clear. .
 They are very helpful and there attention with customer is also very impressive .
 Yours vodafone store employess are very helpful, understandable,realistic and also smart
 Wonderful experience .
 I am getting problem in my network and they asked me to change the sim although the number wil be same but the sim was taken in my brother's name 3 yrs back..he is in germany now,coming after 3 months..you guys dont have any online method of name transfer in this e-generation age
 Good co-operation from the store associate . She solved all my queries .
 Poor voice quality to other person . Couldn't resolve the issue . Going to port out
 Tried to port to postpaid....disregarded thrice...visited store thrice....called 198 only for help....hung up five times.....no contact since barred from198...still no help from ur services provided.. .
 Check my recent request to change my plan . Almost a week nothing has been done . 2 times visited stores and 2 times called customer service . Still no response
 The staff in your store are not well trained . They experiment on the customer s plans . Straightly they are fooling us .
 Why my data is close
 Service was excellent Executive chandni was very helpful & very good on her profession , overall I rate 100% to the service .
 There are all have good communication skill. .
 Service at the store is sad where u have all trainees sitting on the seat, they talk as if they owe vodafone
 I appreciate associate service
 Great response time ! Was dealt with speedily . Everyone was super efficient ! Was out of the store with my work done really fast ! Thank you
 Co operation and service was good and satisfied.... .  .
 I got resolved my problem with in 10 mins including waiting time
 Service of Vodafone is best comparison to others
 They are very slow...in working Careless...but very Slow! !
 Costumer care and store both r not disciplined
 No help . Just trying to sell stuff
 Faltu They Said Jiska Id Proof Hai Usko Bulao Ab Woh ******* Me Hai Toh Kya Kare ...!!? ?
 2 very rude and oversmart
 Waver
 Happy with vodafone network & services... .
 Service has been very pleasant and appreciable
 Q3 : 8
 pooja name of u r person I relied all u r answer
 Can u not sms at 122 in the morning ?
 Good and quicj
 Plz leave me alone . It is HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE 2 txt a survey @ mid-night .
 Most of the executives not at all helpful . Hyper & pathetic attitude towards customer . More often provide contradictory information . No specified waiting times . Not more than half of desks working at a time resulting in prolonged delays . Worst customer service providers in delhi .
 tening . Also maybe u shuld think about calling and taking feedback . When u text at 1230 at night at bed time . It is annoying . Show some class vodafone
 First of all they have irresponsible answers . And i don't find it worth for my problem .
 Am not at all happy wid ur services...both at d store and at the customer care call centres
 Service was too good
 Good
 Not bad good
 There is no network at my office . I don't get calls during daytime . Inspire of many complaint s. . Nothing happened
 It is gud but it has a lot of waiting time til your queries get solved and leas people to handle it. .
 Good experience . Hassle free . Less number of attendants though
 I like babita dealing the reason is that she is always ask about every customer query & solve the issue as well & given the full knowledge .
 The store agent tried to shrugg off the issue first saying it is too "Technical" . When I insisted for solution with other colleagues help he solved the problem . Incidentally he is not the only one in Voda that I have seen with this attitude .
 I was quite satisfied the way my compliant was attended, but if Vodafon team disturbs at this time 11:00pm, then I must think again
 Charanjit very good bro... .
 The info given to customer care executives are never complete They are half and half always .. . Instead when all the question are answered by the manager what's the point in having executives out their and waste their energy in listening to the customers anger .. . Make The manager as the executive .
 Very poor
 Made me run three counters without understanding my query
 I received great response from you even after office hours . She opened the office door, checked the details and gave me new sim card . That's really awesome .
 All d Executives were less knowledgeable about products and very casual in approach
 I AM VERY HAPPY THE BEHAVIOUR OF VODAFONE REPRESENTETIVE
 Polite , courteous and very informative
 As a senior citizen I was offered all the assistance without my asking . Your reps were very courteous . This is for the first time in last 18 years i.e . from the time that I became ur customer a very prompt and excellent service was received by mr . Pl convey my compliments to ur people esprcially Saroja and Zaid and one more gentleman who helped at the cash counter
 they are just good person they give me good & fast service...they are so frdlly that they solve my problem in just 5 minit
 Immediate response towards the complaint

 Convincing means to explain to the customer's querries with patience and to understand them upto their satisfaction .
 Quick and good service was provided to me when I needed a immediate solution .
 I have visited to collect new mobile sim & got it within 15mins, i fully satisfied with Vodafone Store Services . Thanks.. .
 The people in service industry has always a Rome of improvement
 sir,i am very satisfy i giving 1 to 10 full mark u & u r vodafon stor & all executive,thank u
 Reasons : - 1) Abnormality in billing 2) lack of transparency while billing . For each metered use there should be a mechanism to view & review the amount .
 Wost experience they make me fill that iam there servent . I was there for an hour but my concern was not solve yet . sandeep zaid are was are blaming me
 0057006F006E00640065007200660075006C0020007300650072007600690063006500200061006D0020007200650061006C006C0079002000760065007200790020006800610070007000790020D83DDE0A00200066006F007200200075002000720020007300650072007600690063006500730020
 I know the customer support is always nice from voda . But network not so good when I go to places .
 No standard answers Person who convert your services from postpaid from prepaid facing unnecessary procedure issues

 For new information about new offers on data plan . How to say the data on my data pack to more usage . Thanks vodafone and srinivas Exec .

 Customer friendly approach and quick resolution
 Good service!! !

 Yes
 net speed and signals
 Alway your customer care no are busy when i call
 All is well. . (y)
 As a senior citizen I was given preference, secondly explained the process for the work to be done with smiling face and due respect . Helped to get workdone completely
 Customers problems .
 Sim wasn't activated when I was told it would, so had to visit the Vodafone store again
 quest :(
 The air conditioning is pathetic . The wait is too long . Specially since I needed a new sim ( old number) . Someone cud have attended to it earlier . The person wasn't able to complete my request for a new number and more inmortantly it didn't help that he was disinterested . I was charged for the sim that wasn't too kind either
 Excellent
 Best plan/Customer care ppl unerstand ur quarry n solve it out . Tilldate good experience . Hope d same for future .
 Good customer relation... .
 Your executives were lax and inattentive, not giving proper information about the required documents . I had to make three trips to do a simple SIM exchange .
 It was wow evrytime i visitd
 Issue unresolved . Please call if u want to know more:-)
 Call me to find it is about unwanted charge
 he their private calls though they are on the job . They don't believe our genuine queries and issues with the wrong billing and other service transactions . I need to talk to the concern about my wrong billing amount .I'm very much disappointed with your Vodafone employees at the store . They are very reluctant and rude at speaking they make wait costumers and talk on t
 I am not happy with the responce from vodafone wheather it is a store or customer care . In my eye i will rate vodafone as WORST(0). Improvement is required .
 I'am an old customer of vodafone but oflate due to the continous deduction of balance from my account without any usage, i am very disappointed with theservice provided by Vodafone . Even the customer service help desk could not provided me with any satisfactory reason for such deduction . So very sadly ithink ill have to switch over to a different service provider .
 The store is under staffed to meet the demand . You have 8 kiosk and only 4 people to man them . The waiting period to get a 2 minute job took me 1 hour .
 The waiting period for the service is too much, should increase the number of desks
 Not bad . :-D :-P ;- > :-) ;-) B-) :-D :-P ;-) B-)
 Vere nice exp with ravi singh .
 Worst customer service,blind executives who enter totaly wrong address than its customer problem to get it rectified.visited 4 times but who cares as choosing vodafone was my fault .
 Excellent service
 5j
 Waiting was less n the person who attended was receptive and kind
 Nobody wants to listen our problem they think and work like robot
 Awesomw service
 Not a single ac was working . This is probably from last six months . Staff very busy entertaining ladies
 to pay for vodafones fault
 I have been charged 25 rs that should not be charged as per ur employees said... .
 Actually Im spending so much time at gallery due to miss management . The person who are standing at token machine his language is very rough . When Im take token my no is 284 and monitor running no is 246. After all your company is service provider tell to your employee and behave like that . Regard
 I changing my postpaid connection transfar to prepaid .
 Satisfied with the staff attended very nicely helped very nicely
 Yes i m very happy and gaurav pandey who has good behavier and knowladge
 Superb experiance
 The representatives guided and gave information about the services instantly
 No proper response given by the concerns employee . As well no transparency given on the bill details . When I asked about the contact details of higher authority . She refuse to do so . I am calling till date for but no satisfaction given by any one . Really poor response from Vodafone
 10 for both Q 2&3 . Staff attend n give full information of product.
 It was regarding the fact that initially when asked if this number was in name of charuta mandke they said ok get the documents without checking and thenwhen I sent documents they checked and said it s in name of mother alka mandke so again she had to send documents .. Waste of time and energy !
 Token timing is very bad....Pls try to attend customer as earliest....thanks
 s.

 Good service
 Dmd
 Immediate attention given to my problem to resolve it .
 The company Vodafone which was known for valuing its customer has now been changed completely for the services . Being a customer of postpaid for more than 10 years I received the worst experience and Ill treatment from Vodafone . The services are not consumer friendly and has disappointed me . More than that I am hurt .
 to transfer to another operator than suffer more
 FREE
 Service is very good and store manager in Indiranagar Mr.Sagar was very helpful

 Person attending was pleasant, patient and efficient
 First time, I have to wait for 10-15 minutes and my query solved within 5 minutes . It was a nice experience .
 Very fine
 Quick response fast application & polite human approach
 Good service
 The service providers were efficient , and provided services at a glacial pace . Iam glad that vodafone hires people of this calibre
 I have applied for address Change on 29.Oct . That was not considered upto today .
 Thanks for your co-operation.I am satisfied with your service .
 Vodafone = mobilefone
 They don't give proper advice
 Sir your staff at counter are well customers friendly !!!! !   BUT sorry to say your net /wi fi services are totally are not good at all ..... . you salethe product ...not worried about the services ???? ?
 Good system of tokens Helpful store associate Efficient service New SIM activated within 30 min
 People at the store are least bothered about customer service . Wait time is high . Very casual approach for service
 All types of services are good otherwise disturbing of and on while working . I do recommend to others for Vodafone . Thnks .
 Service is absolutely fine but every time we cannot come to the store for renewal of our tarrif plans . And even for internet we facing problems from longtime I even gave the complaint in store also but same thing happening again and again so that's y I gave those ratings other than that everything is fine with the service
 Happy with the service
 Hi thank u, for ur exe don't have knowledge to answer for my issues, iam facing an problem with my 3G, I cud'nt able to connect . Since yesterde . How longu people wil take time to activate, & always I cant visit ur store for small issues .
 I vl text my comments only after seeing my next bill, need to know the changes in plan suggested by ur executive were in my benefit or no.. . Then only Im give a wise comment.. . Thank u.
 I had requested for change in plan I have not had any SMS from the service provider
 I hope that I will get good response from your end Thanks
 Put sims in stock when people visit. . Goods management is poor as you would/must know when you might get out of stock. .
 Never expected the service would be this worst, I might have to change to a different company
 Every thing is good There is no comments in Vodafone service I am using last so many years in my this number
 I saw other desk people gossiping n also the store incharge is not bothered to see the huge inflow of customers. . he should have taken effort to fasten the work
 0061006C006B0069006E0067002E002E002E0020005400680069006E006B0069006E006700200074006F00200070006F0072007400200061006700610069006E0020D83DDE23D83DDE4D
 When ever v go to d store they r least bother to attend as they r busy in der own gossip ... . N on d payment of 500 rs only they keep on calling .. . Inspite of ds dt d customer has payed d bill of 2000 previously .. . But no they will keep on calling n...... . On top of it dy will put d tone ... . Ur paymentis ds n pay it as when v have to make important call.....airtel never does ds .. . Feel like switching on to other services
 cient . Several calls to and from customer service and it still took almost a week for my number to get activated . It was a time consuming and frustratingexperience and has definitely marred my opinion of your brand .
 The staff in the store are very rude . They don't give you the complete list of documents required . They tell you one after another . And your store does not have a photocopy machine . They tell one one docs to get the photocopy . Which is vey inconvenient . Are you people so incompetent that you cannot afford2rs photocopy,While m being using ur service for last 8 years . As i m using iphone n i require pin to remove my sim card while exchanging my sim for nandoesn't even have a 1 paise pin
 It was a excellent a experience with my visit to central plaza store of vodafone . I was in big tension being my phone was lost . Ms prerna and her juniorshave helped me in quick remedial of my problem . As a manager prerna has groomed her team like anything . Simply I would love to appreciate their team andtheir commitment towards valuable customers of vodafone .
 Very poor network, complaints at the service centre go unheard . I had to visit the centre 5 times to get my address changed . Was promised international roaming hassle free, a day before my travel I was forced to pay for activation even though I used international roaming on this number for years . Vodafonemini stores cannot provide . Though the agents are courteous and also helpless sometimes, I am appalled by the overall service of Vodafone .
 I don't want u r services I decided go to another Network.. .
 I am very happy with the service
 Not at all happy with the service both at store and 111. My query is not solve . Associate themselves are not updated with latest information . Very poor service
 I first visited your mini store in vishal nagar, Wakad , Pune . The service was rude and disinterested . Then went to your Baner office were Rakesh was very helpful and helped me beyond what I had gone for - if the first experience was very bad, the 2nd was excellent
 Please suggest the offers which suitable for there devices.. . other wise it will be inconvenience for the client. .
 Pl.call
 1. To speak with ur employee i waited more than 1 hour . 2. They enable to resolve my prblm 3. This is the third time i came to ur store , but the prblm i
 Inept trg .
 There is a issue in issuing the bill to me..everytime when i go there the staff is not supportive eniugh to help me out.. .
 Nobody is responsible.when we want service nobody pick the phone.poor service.after 3 month we want to port another network
 Living netwrk
 Reasons:- 1. I have corporate 375 monthly postpaid plan with unlimited free internet, I received promotional sms saying - "Offer only for you . Get additional 1 GB 3G data at INR 150 for 2 biking cycle" I activated it as per details in sms - just because to get additional 3G data NOT TO Change my rental plan . But your system . Changed my monthly rental plan to INR 250 + 750 without intimating me . 2. I logged my complaint for same in Vodafone store by showing original promotional sms . They agreed on my complaint and took my request to cancel INR250+INR 750 plan and revert back to INR 375 plan . But I didn't happen so and I received bill of INR 1500 for this month . 3. I again visited same store to discuss about this issue, they said we never raised complaint to cancel INR 250+INR 750 plan!! ! They said you should take tab on progress and do follow up its your mistake! ! Unnecessarily I'm paying 1000 bugs extrawithout using that 3G data at all .
 Great experience
 Good service
 Requesting for paper bill for the last six months but no response n no one hears
 Duplicate sim started working after 2 days .
 Staff is friendly and co-operative Store is well maintained
 The service was fast and the people working were really helpful .
 They helped me all time .so I am very happy .
 Waiting for just getting a nano sim card for 25mins was not appreciated also the team couldn't help for better plan for Vodafone red
 VERY NICE .ALL THE STAFF EXECUTIVE ARE WELL TRAINED and ready to help .cashier is also very active After all one of the best store
 Problem solving & handling was very good . But had to wait for approx half an.hour to get my number despite of no other person in que

 Compared to last visit, this visit was very good . Service here was good . Ritherdon road branch was very much annoying .
 U r nt telling bedt options to client
 It is rated 10 due to the outstanding service of your Store Associates .
 I was very happy with the service & executive
 After Ranaghat l have to face connection problem daily .
 Vodafone red plan not activated after giving a visit and executives are unaware of the process.. . Not trained. .
 I tooked a sim on 7 DEC which was faulty from begining then to ur store charged me for new that was unfair thing . And then reason given to me for chargeswas unsatisfactory .
 Every thing is good iam very happy
 Very poot service, staffs are busy for gossiping , do notainten any sereal no . , un nessrery waiting .

 Indifferent service,very lax,my RM is much better that too on the phone
 Am fed up of visiting your store ! Why can't people customer support resolve my problem ! Your service is getting bad to worse, if you guys don't wake up
 I visited vodafone store and satisfied their service . All staps are active & industrious, also gisl's ***** attract me .
 Got prompt service and staff had good technical knowledge to solve my problem .
 I AM VERY HAPPY WITH U R SERVICE.
 Internet data plans are misguiding me .
 The wait was forever and lack of staff and very lengthy process which was ridiculous
 Technically services r very good or i can say best but administratively n behaviorwise its worst
 Your staff needs more training to create harassment to customer under pretext of working under policy and manners speak to clients . Regards, Dharmesh Desai
 Vase fakera is very helpful, resolved my issue within 3 mints, she has fantastic process knowledge
 I was able to get a good cooperation from the Manager and this cooperation boost up the confidence in the customer . Thanks .
 Need to improve office maintenance
 Best service of store
 As they are entertaining without token no .
 Its a wonderfull service . .
 All right
 Good skilled ppl.. . I was happy that I got my Nano SIM activated in few hrs which d other stores were prolonging the process . Finally my new Xperia Z3 iswith Vodafone n awaiting for 4G network services.. .
 Not interested Regards, Irshad A Shaikh .
 The support executive Manoj was very helpful . However it would have been great if corporate clients are offered door step services .
 Fine . First of all I like Vodafone and my number also . In future I am in need of any local number I definitely choose Vodafone only . Thank u. Happy to help
 It is good but can be better
 The employees at the stores r not polished . They need more grooming .
 Overall outstanding service .
 Very good customer interaction
 You **** ?
 The process of getting a replacement Sim and transferring my contact list to the new phone took over an hour and a quarter . The actual work was fifteen m
 Excellant over all . I am your brand fan . I have totally 4 connections . If possible avail me a nice offer .
 Very nice behavie . Help & support By Mr.Alok

 Good service
 The store associate was able to resolve my problem and also discuss the appropriate plan according to my usage . Also the Vodafone store is near my working area . Which helps to get my things resolved in a better and faster way
 Vodafone india is really bad .
 e network put the blame on the mobile set .
 Actually m not satisfied wid vodafone services regading balance
 Hy thk duj ft ussi
 Worst services
 I like the service of Vodafone . Vodafone gives the best service . Takes quick actions regarding customers complaints . Overall it's the best service I hadever enjoyed .
 For the first a customer was pretty upset and your staff had no answer
 Everything about the service in the store is good except for the waiting.. . More number of desks would help us reduce the waiting time
 I was attended by 3 people and they pass my query to other staff person as they are in capable to reply .
 Good customer service by deepthi & team
 I found the store associate very helping,they spoke very nicely with me and they welcomed my each query.thanks
 Firstly the gentleman who was near the token kiosk was very rude . Secondly i had to wait almost 20 minutes though there were only 4 people before me andthe particular vodafone store had 6 counters .
 Try to reduce the waiting time for guests took me almost one hour for clarifying a small issue
 Understanding the need of the customer more deeply . Comfort given in arranging missing documents
 very poor
 No comments thanks
 Ur store associate was vry polite and helpful while our conversation.I m happy to b a Vodafone user .
 The staff niraj who has attended me was very polite n quick n helpful
 Prompt but need to be more courtious . Yr Nessapkm outlet man needs training
 Your billing method is very unlikely , your store staff is so bad behave with customers . .. . Your all company is corrupted .. Your are thief's
 splay but not working . Don't keep or put tag not working .
 It's service is good but it doesn't provide best internet offer .
 Cordial and helpful reception .
 It took hardly 3 mins to clear my doubts as u can understand the value of time
 Here to help person in the store as soon as you walk in the store is the best thing Vodafone has done If you are being attend by a person as soon as youentered, I guess that is probably the best thing possible in customer service .
 It's very super fast service
 Ambience Well trained staff No hassle & no overcrowding
 Good
 Good service but the waiting and turn around time is very frustrating .
 Your customer service is pathetic. . First i ask you to change billing cycle and you failed. . After that you billed me incorrectly so i asked you to getme a better plan with more std minutes. . He changed my plan and removed incoming isd calls. . When i ask him to reactivate it he is asking me to 5000 deposit which is completely nonsense. . Again i requested to change number to prepaid. . The store agent telling me to come on 12th to do that. . This is completely ridiculous. . I have to travel almost 25km to do this . . I Will never recommend any one to vodafone
 Good
 Am very happy with sunil
 simply awesome
 Non cooprative staff in vodafone storer
 Poor service for us .
 Quick response &appropriate guidance .
 problem as usual .
 I want the world calling card...your staff says they will provide in more then one week....this is so disgusting...how *** they dont have wcc
 Store is not clean, out of 4 only 2 counters had attendants and the waiting period was long.there are no seats for waiting period and that is basic.counters are too close for privacy or confidentiality, people on d next counter can easily hear our mobile nos n entire discussion
 Ofcourse store so gd
 Custmor k bare me bhi sochte aap or aapki company recharge krne k bad b aap whi call rate apply kr rhe ** bat pado ki bhi h bat h haram k khane ki jo aapki company kha rhi h or aap jse log hi cruption ki wagah bnte h ok
 I like Vodafone and its services
 I m satiafied fully with services provided by ur staff .
 Very nice
 Last time i visited the store for cug activation as the store associate had raised the issue but the backend updation was wrong
 1. Patient listening to my case 2. Careful analysis og my case 3. Prompt resolution
 Good ambience good system for que needs more sitting for waiting courtsey &promtness of associate
 I was promised to be given 2g connection free in the Vodafone store frazer town , when I went for porting to airtel . Since airtel was offering me better
 Different answers from different exuctive
 To much crowd and customer care taker are slow in work as well atmosphere not good enough no sitting arrangement for waiting person .
 I hv a biling issue...every time i am charged for the usage that i dont do and my phone is disconnected even after requesting its nit connected again
 Good good good
 Ok
 Be honest give a right bill to customer without using internet charge internet usage in bill .
 Good
 First train your employees how to behave with the customers and also give product training properly...bcoz they don't have much knowledge...bcoz of your
 V ve wait dr til our token no . comes it ll b too long to wait n nly vodafone music hw many times to listen it wuld b better if dr s radio . Nw a days dr call rates r also too high normal ppl cnt aford it . It wuld b better if cal rates bcom low
 Unnecessarily misguiding customers . I only wanted to convert my existing sim to micro sim . But was told by the store that, to do that I have to registerfor m-paisa . This shows the cheap tactics played on customers by vodafone . Pathetic !! !
 Waiting time of 45 minutes is too much .
 I,m ignored by your CSA
 My No.9888676493 is still not activated
 The quality of service is good
 Your service providers in the store were found to be very cooperative with the customers . Their pleasing approach attracted me very much . They behaved ina very friendly manner . But, sorry to tell you that they could not explain why net is not always available in my area .
 Takes too much time to respond & not clear in clarifying doubts .
 It was an excellet exeperiece
 thre were cameras installed .. . u shud check it urself
 Good service
 Lots of waiting time and executives are least helpful ready to shrug off their responsibility at spurt of a moment don't put in any effort to resolve the issue .
 Good to know that vodafone store in on Sohna road .
 Improve band width
 The waiting period was high n comfort of a chair also not av.but the rep brijesh was quick eficient n courteous
 Even after paying the bill just because they didnot upload it my connection was cut and even before that before each call i had to keep hearing the warning of not paying the bill which was actualy poor service since it was both irritating and time waste
 Superb service
 1-Visitind vodafone is like have to take 1day leave from office . 2- money deduction or billed enough thats in your profession . 3-no queue system ,no display working, 4 counter were empty, technical issue every time in sector 18 noida ? 4- soon i ll go for pre paid Thanks

 e seating space made available .
 Immediately at entrance helper took me to dealing man i was disposed quickly
 THE BILL PAYING COUNTER PERSON BEHAVIOUR WAS DISGUSTING
 The interaction and information delivered by the associate was quiet convincing and an ease to understand . Conversations were carried out in a very patient way . Though, the only kink in the eye still remains, as no appropiate postpaid plans are available as per customers need, not even in Vodafone red .
 Your store assocciate attitude is very good
 ope that you will increase your 3G communication in rural areas also . That's what I expect from you .
 Great service . Very customer friendly . Keep it up !
 courtious reffffception patient hearing only flaw if it can be called a flaw if at a particular point of time five customers come there r only three staf
 Wen i asked fr help after entering d guy put me on to wrong person fr my prob . Then d lady put me back to him . Then sameer solved my prob promptly .
 Satisfied
 First rectify your network problem . Even unable receive proper signal at ITPL.
 ervices are good .
 No use
 They were not talking properly .and they did not sole my problem and kept giving excuses . So please call me my sim card is having problem regarding network .
 I visited vodafone store after porting to get cheap calling rates and free sms offer which is currently running . But they are not ready to activate thatoffer instead they are telling it is retailer offer . Shame on them to sit in vodafone store .
 No specific reason given for unknown charges in my bill
 I got good explation by g lokaesh kumar
 It Is Good store but They Take Extra Amount So Avoid That
 Awesome surrounding and service clas area.candidate is deserving hatsoff
 Vodafone must inform customers about all rentals being charged
 Ur staff was quick efficient courteous friendly nd most helpful . I had anticipated it wd tk ages to get a new connection but it just took 10 minutes . Ex
 Fulfilled my requirements quickly with good understanding and care .
 I satisfy voda rates and service.i use v more than 5yrs .
 There was too much work load on your executive and she was very much puzzled .
 Good
 I got perfect solution to my problem so I am happy with your services .
 Vodafone says "happy to help". But it dosnt help . I am a loyal customer of vodafone since the time of 'Hutch'. And this is my 3 rd vodafone connection..But what I am getting from postpaid is not what I was expecting . My last numbers were 9719537341, 9999140121
 The interaction with vodo store staff is fine, but over all fictions is not fare that has to improve . So i have awarded only 2 points .
 Response is so good
 Anamika associate geniully very helpful and well behaved
 Courtesy of the personnel at desk, Loyalty towards Vodafone, Work Accomplished in a Successful way each time we visit the store, and the ease and convenience has propelled us to give this rating .
 Every thing is good at your store as well as network.i woud like to continue in this network only.the services of this network are reliable,prompt and perfect .
 Good adjustment have miss Rajni
 I was having problems with services but in bellary zone Mr. B.k.girish resolved problems
 Good service received
 Your staff was very courteous and helpful . But they could tell us facts instead of us asking for it . Very speedy work . Very impressed by that
 On 9 without i calling any calls my balance nearly 50rs has been raised or asccesed.y
 It was overall good vipin was very polite however your systems need advance technology . .goodluck Amit

 Late and inapropriate service

 The person who handled the complaint was quick to understand the problem and took immediate action
 Other than guard blocking the entrance physically rest of the experience at showroom was very good
 Most untrusted telecom brand in our area . Store executives dnt knw how to talk, dnt knw the reason of the problem.not seem to be interested in solving the problem.much more . Totally dissatisfied and ready to port out .
 100% satisfie
 Good. .
 Time wasting
 I want vodafone main store erode ?
 I satisfied . I understood to all information
 I meet with amar and is helpful and knowledge of product
 Bcoz the guy who listen my problm he gavee resultion with my complaint number . Nic to meet him thnx
 It's a bad experience - even after paying the amount service got disconnected for a day, vet bad Vodafone
 one . The staff were very sweet . But I felt the procedures were complicated . And the staff were not clear about some procedures .
 I'm being made to run around for inefficient systems/staff deployed by Vodafone. . Will take a serious view if matters reported are not rectified. .
 There was no sitting arrangement it was only 1 couch was there . Over all service was good .
 Your billings is unreasonable , your customer sakes support not able to convince . I requested to activate caller tune from past 3 months still not done .
 Store is good but small and having no space for sitting
 I have always used vodafone for the last 12 years . I have never been disappointed by the service you guys provide . I have just shifted from kolkata to raipur and the experience with vodafone is just as same as was in kolkata . Thank you Team Vodafone .
 The entire process of corporate connection application us painful . The plan committed is still not provided . Hence, bloated billing as on today . Still donot have data plan activated . More than a month now .
 I have appreciated my experience of visiting the store but sometime the person standing other-side of the desk tries to be smart . Make sure they always make customer comfortable
 Unsatisfied policies n awaiting for turn
 Every associate friendly and good service nature . Overall good .
 Very friendly
 Your staffs approach is much appreciated .
 First of all your company polish Nd then company want its maintain Goodwill with out expenses
 This was good experience to talk with ur executive . She was clear and loud to hear .
 Good care and good advais with good help .thanx vodafone .
 Very helpful staff most if the time . Very crowded and the pressure shows on the staff . Have seen them being rude to customers a strict no no
 The speed & courtesy shown by employee
 well service im so happy to help me
 Your service provider are very lier .
 My experience only .
 Thay all are very decipliend . But humanity less can't create a normal condition which behave like he is really in his home . Vodafone family
 The associate doesn't treat me properly she just talking on phone and doesn't realy hear me why i am switching my number to prepaid, it was my worst experience in vodafone store .
 good service provide me by shadab he is a good manager
 Very Good supporting staaf friendliy aadmostfear
 The details I asked for could have been simplified . Also, since I WILL have to visit the Vodafone store they could have told me to come there and they would help me activate the roaming . The cost of activation, documentation and verification must be explained in step wise manner
 Quickly respond... .
 Pathetic.. .
 too . And lastly Vodafone is chifer . And no cheater .
 They didn't take action on request in single visit..very lazy .
 Its good service network
 Fully satisfied n delighted for service & 10 /10 for Vodafone executive Mayuri .
 I learnt from there that I had no Internet plan had not been kept in 199 plan as promised with 1GB free for three months feel cheated n will port soon
 Excellent reply by costumer representative . Good service experience . Thanks to vodka phone
 .my service request was rejected for a silly reason of over writing which could have been managed without any difficulty.this sort of service is not expected from the world leader in mobile company like Vodafone .
 Good training Good support staff There was time management . Good service Bless Vodaphone staff and organisation . Management and all .
 Good. .
 Polite staff, prompt & timely action

 Very good . 5star
 Not informative/no politeness/arrogant staff/made me to wait 20 mins unnecessary/
 Who are agent has handled the store they are very arrogant...it was bad experience for me
 The way they approach is very bad and they will not properly guide the people
 I like ur service

 Mr pandey is very helpful . He is asset for vodafone
 Custemer care call 198 not connected...very bad
 Not at all user freindly

 No one assist in the store . If customer wait, store people will busy with there work and customer will un attend for long
 Customer service and overall response is fine .
 Test

 111 customer care did not resolve the problem & asked to visit store for same . UPE Cust care not reachable on email . Incorrect billing & failure to follow customers instructions for which I have to run around. . Busy life & time is less can't afford to run around for Vodafone's mistakes .. Assuming errorsdue mistake & not wrong intent .
 Customer care officers should do some responsibility for their job, if possible ask any customer care officer to call me .
 Internet very bad conditions wen we ar at office or at home very bad Internet can access
 So that u can come to know how u r employess r providing service to customers if anything went wrong they can correct it We have AIRTEL store in that response they give is 0 they will even not give any answer to customers properly
 It is not dificulte to run yr company but it is so difficult to run yr company on poper way
 Its 3G ..your 3G services are very poor ...I am a 3G user and i am not satisfied at all...even your store keepers seems to be helpless and they appearto be clueless when I go wirh 3G complain .
 As soon as I entered the facility , I was greeted by security with a welcoming smile . He asks what what I needed . I told him and he directed to a desk . There counsellor Trinadh was sitting . He too had a very gracious attitude and he patiently listened to my issue and was very helpful and within minutes solved my issue . He even asked if I needed anything else and he would help our . I returned home a very happy and satisfied customer! ! :)
 Associate who answered all our queries was very co- operating . I forget his name . Good job
 Promt immediate attention given ti a st citixen
 We are satisfied .
 My visit to your stores is cordial, but you got to improve your service . You have to scale you service not customer visit to ur store .
 I request for tariff change but till now no response
 Your activation process is too slow . Please make it some more faster . Thankyou.
 Time taken more due to less no of staf
 Waiting time & interaction during that period
 I am fully satisfied with Vodafone services Using since 25 yrs Didn't ever switched to any other service My queries are always cleared Thanx
 I have written an email last month to u all. . My bill cycle was changed once without notifying me to the 1st . I accepted ur apology, it is not changed again without notifying me to te 18th . For ur blunder I'm expected to pay 3 bills at one go now. . I don't know what is my allowance available or if I'm being overcharged .. I just have to keep knocking ur doors either by calling, emailing visitng ur centre and now texting. . U think customer has no other work is it ? Ten times visit u? Now after the bill is generated again I have to knock ur doors to correct it. . Vodafone is rubbish ..
 No good approach towards customers . In one word its just not well mannered for customers . I don't understand employees they are working for customer service or some market service . While one customer is served they take and speak with second customer, with out any appology .
 I am very satisfied ,good experience
 Over all I do appreciate the services provided at the store . Thanks for the service .

 Your answer of my every question is completely perfect and way of talking also very smooth ..that's why my rating is 10out of 10..
 I would like to say that they are only hearing store ,not solution store .
 A 3 of 4. Outstanding experience at the store intersection . I was greeted and asked 4 or 5 times in a span of 45 minutes . 10 out of 10
 No
 Waiting time is less
 sit the store . What aggravated the agony was the long wait and no differentiation between processes requiring mor and less time .
 vodafone I am using fr almost 5 years and my last vist was the one I never had to argue fr anything with the attender who understood my concern and donethe needful

 Please try to improve ur customer relation and help to sort out customers problem, only nice talk is not good
 Courteous, well mannered n prompt
 1. For 3G connectivity not working properly I have been intimated that 3G is not active from Vodafone side which I was using for more than 1.5 month . Then executive told me to send one SMS ACT VMC to 144 and after 4 hrs it will get activated . But even after 12 hrs it was the same case then after googlingI came to know that activation SMS was for prepaid and not postpaid . Finally still I am experiencing the same internet issue problem . Is it a fault fromcustomer that whenever he changes the plan such problem will happen ? Moreover have seen executives are fighting between themselves regarding checking and
 The persons at store, shailesh is very friendly .
 lodged the complaint to replace the dongal in case of post paid net data card i am getting speed of net too slow as well as getting more disturbances while we are on skype . Deshpande shrikant .
 ASSESMENT OF HELP AND SERVICE
 nt inform me eventhough they had my number .
 I just wanted to clarify my bill details, Vodafone executive allowed a third party lady to speak in between who was in a civil dress and having no ID car
 Attention was great . Requirements were immediately resolved .
 I got very good experience.. .
 Lack of customer care
 card was not working for payment . So I had no chance to pay 350 instead I paid 500. Cancellation process is very bad .
 Free
 The courtesy and manners extended are good while attending to my request .
 Good service by vishwa.he is friendly.and i liked hs service
 another service centre on my way to Hyderabad where solution suggested was to get sim replaced . But she could fix it by making changes in handset
 Credit card machin not working, not giving proper information regarding net pack, arrogance in communication

 Communication skill of your associate is very good . My all doubts are cleared .
 Excellent service
 Ya respnse is good and shop is very attractive and ladies staffs are also attractive
 Scope for improvements
 Read the ticket comments in chat with your support . Remember to see the feedback also
 personel talk .
 Great expression
 They did not have pin to remove the SIM card for iPhone . A few chairs for old people to sit would be welcome .
 Staff is not at all willing to help and the manager is very rude, Not interested in listening to the customers problem also .
 Store associates are very helpfull
 It took me 2 hours to get a new connection . Being directed from one line to the other . Staff was not courteous and unorganized .
 Very good service on your khopprkharne store ..
 free . busy chit chatting within themselves . carelessness . bitter experience with vodafone
 Excellent service.. .
 **** you how many questions do you'll ask
 Outstandin experience from service of vodafone employee mr rajat tyagi

 Good service
 Service was good. .
 Poor service, rude behaviour
 I am a very senior citizen, 82 years old, and handicapped since I use a walkhng stick and have difficulty in standing even for 5 minutes . Your Stores Associate understood my problem and very promptly helped me and registered my complaint . I had gome to U S A on 17th September 2014 for 6 months and kept my 2 mobile telephones - 9870099461 and 9870099462 - for Safe Custody for which I am charged Rs . 300.00. I had to return to Mumbai on 27th November 2014, that is, after 2 months and 10 days, due to Medical Emergency . I wanted to know whether I can get REFUND for the period for which I did NOT keep my telephones in Safe Custody . Your Stores Associate helped me in this matter . I AM SURE VODAFONE WILL REFUND ME THE AMOUNT.
 I am very happy
 Very helpful associate
 Good service
 Because i received immediate help
 Vodafone is not user friendly. .
 No result find
 Huge waiting, no proper go through of tokens, very rude answers
 Excellent service
 Associate present their was not interested in attending customers, She was behaving as if vodafone doesnt care and you should leave as soon as possible .
 Increase your customer service manpower.. .
 VERY long wait ! When My turn was suppose to come, the executive started attending someone ELSE, where as I was standing right next to the desk waiting for My turn . The executive was rude in giving excuses as why he was attending the other one & not Me. And then he said that My token has been closed !
 Helpful advisor .
 my sim was lost and your service system is very very good . Finally i got a new sim the same no .
 Vodafone services is very nice & his network is very strong they all rural areas are available vodafone network rly such a vodafone is a very nice company
 Satisfactory completely no more words
 Took 5days to activate SIM.. Staff told SIM will be activated in 2hours on 5th Dec
 I made a complain which was told that it would be solved in 4 hours and still its not its giving me alot of problem
 Happy for the Vodafone service's.. .

 I manage to get the job done very fast and good way
 Service & the executives were too good & the explanation & the patience of ur team was amazing so no question about that I can give u guys less than 10
 I hv been using Voda from 2004 n am very satisfied with the network . N very happy with not only store also ur customer care executives .
 Its a very helpful envrnmnt there i fild it and finly resolve my prblm so i thankful
 Excellent work
 nts . New employees do not have authority to make decisions . Try to build up a system that your call centre employees can not disconnect the calls . You have 198 number for complaints but they really can't take complaints regarding Internet connections and if you have a corporate connection then you have tosend e-mail . Why you can't complain on 198 if you have a corporate connection . There are so many problems you have in your system i cannot explain oversms .
 Non helpful service received at store so going to terminate my services with Vodafone . Its better to have Airtel instead Vodafone .
 Yr service(signal) r so poor other then companies, yr's maneger r not attend but u will billing from yr side
 I've been a Vodafone customer for a long time . Whenever i've visited the store, i've found the staff extremely helpful and attentive
 The team could be little more friendly and give ease to the customer . I am a loyal customer of Vodafone using this number ever since I started using mobile, however I didn't feel important visiting the store, although my queries were resolved . This visit to a gallery was almost after3 years . Thank you !
 Wait is too long
 I'm very satisfied he was very helpful n understanding kind if person had a no trouble to visit a store
 I didn't found anything good there , any solution for my problem Now I am going to consumer forum for registering complaint against your company
 uld ideally be solved with "mobility". Frustrating to say the last .
 As I went to one of the associate .. . He sent to another table . There this guy was busy doing something in his laptop which was not welcomeing.He also quralled
 I had to wait for long and there were only two counters working instead of having so many of them
 I got my no back that too same no in less time m happy to use vodafon
 its .
 Very helpful and supportive . Thanks
 The guy today was fabulous and he helped a lot so I appreciate and Vodafone should have people like him who really knows what is customers expectations and needs . Thank u and please give him an award if possible as he deserve it
 Mmm first of all you Waiting is more over there..! !
 Gud

 Great customer service and very helpful staff . Very friendly and reliable place .
 lot of waiting time at store and executives simply insist on sending mails and SMS for itemised bill charges of 75 in 3 bills . I need reversal of itemised bill charge service which had been charged before activation never activated and amounted to charges of 150 rupees . This sort of auto charges which leads to harrasment of customer should be stopped hence average rating
 My request is given on 14th oct for Rs,280/- but still it not credit my acct

 Vodafone service is good n co-operate with costumer .. .
 Good ambience and helpful people
 The problem is that i went to the store twice and there were too many people both the times, the waiting time was more than 10 minutes each time while there was no provision to sit in the store
 Are you kidding me . Why my 3G is not activated by your store . I will throw your sim
 ed we'll get better service . So facing these I've given the numeric .
 It's not your store or the workers but it companies policy of money money money money....screw the client
 Solve my problem or I've to complain to trai .
 In ayanavaram area near railway hospital, vodafone signal is very bad for the past one month . Please rectify
 I was duly attended in very satisfied way..appreciated
 The visit to the store ws a waste ydy as i hd to follow up on this n visit d store again for the same work . Call me to know more on this .
 I went to your office to transfer my prepaid plan to post paid plan . One Mr Pavan Kumar attended me . I was given a detailed information of various plansand he suggested me the best plan suited for my requirements . His behaviour and conversation were quite impressive . I being a senior citizen, I was givendue respect and I am happy about it .

 Only net problem we are facing
 Your help service is good and i am appreciate your work and your store associate .
 Why r u putting over bill because ur fault that why iam loss my money every month
 My 2g connection speed is very very slow . I am using nokia lumia mobile . Than i am finally decided to go through idea . Its 2g speed is more batter than Vodafone . And the price is same .
 If I have any problem with vodafone network or services, after complaning in the nearest vodafone store or talking with customer care they didn't satisfied me on my complaints .

 Very good
 0 (very dissatisfied)
 your vodafone store good
 Good & responsive people
 3 Staff walked off their desks even though there were many people waiting with tokens
 The store was overcrowded.the staff did their best.So my observation is that you should put in more staff in such an important location
 excellent service
 Very happy with ur service people tnx for d good service .. .
 I m being charged for downlods which i have never done .
 I have not got satisfactory response from Vodafone on network issue we are facing at sector 15 kharghar . Please resolve this issue immediately .
 Nice service
 Store management is poor, maximum seats r vacant . Very few r attending at a strech, so as a result heavy rush is going on in d store .
 Was fair enough
 I liked the way your person redponded
 I was not talked to politely when I was being so polite . The staff just gave me no supporting stand from their side . And told me to drop a mail at a particular email id and wait for their reply and clarify your query from them .
 The waiting time was over 50 minutes We were never informed on arrival the duration for the same The person issuing the token was extremely rude
 To employ more technically sound persons in gallery who can gv proper solution for clients problems
 Still I am received through email or hardcopy from last 3 month
 I will really be glad to help you understand the reasons for my rating . 1. U hire liars as your employees . On 8th December 14 I got a call from Pranav,this guy lied to me that he will resolve my issue and refund Rs . 400 + the taxes for that . I had asked him to activate the Internet services . He only activated the Internet service . The issue I had was never reported by him, which he told me will be forwarded to the store manager . I went to the store andAltaf at dombivli store told me that a refund for 3 months had been processed on the 6th for my issue . I wanted it for the 8 months, for which he againraised a ticket . I told him regarding my phone conversation with Pranav . Which he confirmed was a false and Pranav never raised a ticket for refund . HisId is Pranav Chavan 1. Group . CS HSG QUALITY SR# 1630839452 I need to speak with someone responsible who can resolve the issue for me .
 Y
 Ur manpower is too low and very untrained . No sense of communication . I didn't like the way they treat their customer .
 Good
 No time
 Call me then i will tell my bad experience
 Prompt action , good service
 very satisfied
 Monthly bill is not received to me neither by massage nor by mail . On 22 nov i got call to inform the bill & after 23 nov my service is stop . You needto improve your service give a massage to customer on 5 of month so as to get time to pay the bill . This month also i dont get any massage or mail regarding bill value .
 Very Likly -9
 Good co-operation
 Very very poor service u r store
 thanking u
 It took more than half a day to get the sim activated and the data part doesn't seem to be working .
 I got all my work done . Totally 3 different job . So appreciate the help .
 Very helpful
 thanks you very much... !
 Poor network connectivity especially near Indirapuram, extremely poor complaint resolution attitude, misleading feedback on complaint status
 Good service by d knowledgeman . Akshay .
 Required information were given with in the time
 We have 31 cug connections from you . Nobody is giving head and everytime there is billing and limit problem and nobody is coming to resolve the issue . Ifthis will prolong, we are forced to swap the connection to other service provider .
 Nice service and corparation
 Net is not working
 The guy who attended is good
 I am happy with your replay . i am waiting for 1 more day to active my sim
 Coz they not help customers to get post paid to pre paid even it is very simple procedures, they had called me three times and now had called me back on
 Since you asked, in short I would say that your service has fallen by 20% to 30%. As per my experience since Maxtouch .
 The store associates used to change for every couple of minutes, they themselves do not know anything in detail about what ever I ask . If I tell them to
 a,per koi solution nahi mela.can u help me .
 I'm a vodafone customer for a decade now and was very happy with the services till now . But since last 4 months calls are constantly dropping so i decided to go to airtel . When i enquired about portability at vodafone store, the executive didn't show interest in answering my queries . This was wrong and bad on his part
 The executives in centre was very polite and intelligent . Very nice intellectual level . Dealing was also very good . That is it .
 I like very sastisfied with your service . Thankyou for giving such a experence .
 Ok
 Your service, billing plan, response to our queries are all very poor . We are very unhappy with your network .
 nal call and data charges for roaming not waived of then I shall be left with no option then to port my no . back to Aircel .
 I got my query resolved yesterday but again my GPRS was deactivated today Even after activating my data plan for 1599 I really don't know what is happening
 Thanks for help
 Assured solution in 2 hours even after 1 day not yet solved, irritating service reminders, hating to the core
 Best service
 Customer service was good .
 While all conditions stayed good I was disappointed that the store didn't have the equipment to transfer my contacts from my 14 year old sim to the new one . I have to figure that out myself . :- (
 first is timing I spent 1and 1.5 hour in store.total time westeage
 easy and quick approach,kind and quick solution
 Everyone was very understanding and soft spoken .
 I really hate the service tht the company is providing we are giving the money to company for 3G speed But in return the speed I m not getting
 From 10
 I have already given my complaint to store and also on Callcenter yesterday at 11 pm
 No proper communication . Ppl r saying go there and go there
 Very bad
 Please accept the bankers letter as an address proof .
 Your executives at vodafone care are not supportive . They are not ready to understand the problem but always escalate to the other department . Customer suffers due to delay in services and lack of support .
 CS executives don't wants to hear customers at any cost, the behavior of the persons deployed in the store just play the blame games . Instead of providing solutions they try to feel that it is our mistake for using Vodafone's connection .
 d appreciate vodaphone service or how to react .
 Very bad customer service
 As per instructions laid down in the ECS form I annexed a photocopy of a cheque but your officials refused to accept it and told me to give an original cancelled cheque .
 Customers R Waiting Executives R Not There In There Seat,i Have To 35 Minute Then I Left The Store .
 Know waiting, understanding my problem
 There s no available of complete explanation about the requested process . Although the atmosphere s customer friendly
 Takes too much time  Nt so frankly  Dont suggest correctly
 Vodafone is the best . The service, network, plans all is excellent . I have been using
 VERY GOOD
 Very poor service after a long wait the staff had no knowledge of what they were doing, every customer in the store was complaining of the long wait andinadequate poor service . Very sad to see Vodafone in such a poor state in india, i live in spain and all the mobile providers service is immaculate and quick including vodafone,VERY SAD AFFAIR.
 Overall good one
 Dec.14 k bill m Rs.247 net charge aaya h. Mene net band krba rkha h.

 0 experience was worst'''''
 I have visited Vodafone store twice , was kept waiting for 2 hrs and finally che fed the bill plan from 899/ to my original corporate plan 249/- rental nthe 1 gb internet plan . confirmed it twice n then as per the Vodafone executives instruction did the message for the same . But still after so much time consuming procedure why the data plan the so called booster plan was for 1 month only ? Did I wait in this que for this 1month plan ? Why he failed togo on with the 1 gb plan (250/-), as I had already told him 10 times . ? Why am I charged now 1500+ for the internet use ? Why the ISD roaming was still active as I was told that it's been deactive as I had personally given my time n made it a point that it's done ( approximately on 15-16-17 October )I m not going to pay the internet data charge which is been charged to me , or else would prefer discontinue using ur services .
 Store staff explained very clearly to me .
 The staff were cordial,we are happy with the service .
 Very gud service frm suradhi krishnan
 ve come for 1600 was billed to me at 5000 n consequentially I haven't paid the bill .. . Please get the issue sorted .. I have been a good customer with vodapone since the time is started using the phone .. . I don't wana get into situation to switch to other network ..

 Good service .
 Token machine not working, no priority to premium customer, no nano sim available
 Service was good .
 Had to wait a bit longer than usual . Customer friendly though . Happy with the service .
 Service & your people are good, but due to less employee, it takes long time to get the service .
 kormangla store manager n even staff is not treating the customer the way it should b in customer service...first of all there is no parking and i parkedmy bike in non parking zone thought that this will finish in 5 minutes..this was the 3 rd time they asked me to come again for same reason n still my job is not done...they r not giving clear communication what all documents is required and make us running everywhere then telling thqt this is our problem.. .
 I had to go twice to get my doubt clarified ! The activation of my request is possible only from next month they told .
 I donot want to explain.mistakes happened &appologised for the inconvenience caused by the staff.so I donot have any issue on the subject . I am yr customer for last 10 yrs & I rate Vodofone the best .
 Very very unwilling behavior to solving the query of the Customer

 One day before the billing cycle, I went to convert my number from postpaid to prepaid . But after lot of request they forced me to keep the postpaid plan . Actually due to uncontrolled billing coming every month, I wanted to put control on it by converting to prepaid . That day they convenienced me that last bill was more due to late payment charges and it will be low if i pay in time . But on the same night I got the bill which was again a high bill . So onnext day I went again to convert it . But on that day they said you have to pay unbilled amount costing 200 with outstanding bill . I told them yesterday only i came to convert it and you forced me to keep the plan and now because of you, if i want to convert i am loosing 200 extra without my fault . Now aga

 Good communication

 Take some action against your staff of lajpat nagar staff espacially (saba) she is rude
 No patience in motivating custemer
 No one is happy to assist . You have to pull info out of the folks .
 Ok good
 Just becuase of mr . Prince.....he deserve 10+ ....the person just resolved my 1 month problem within 2 minutes... .
 The reason for visiting vodafone store (park st an dalhousie) on 8th dec,2014 was that i want 2 purchase another vodafone prepaid connection (micro sim)for nokia asha 503 handset but in your store they were saying that in prepaid it is not available,only in postpaid it is available and even i was not interested in postpaid connection they were try to conviencing me to purchase postpaid sim and aftr 3 months convert into prepaid connection or purchase prepaid standard sim . So my ques to you that how it is possible, that in postpaid new connection or replacement sim , micro sim was available and in prepaidnew connection it was not available ?
 Your Service Is Very Fast Because Dataplan Is Very High Cost
 I was informed to contact at vodophone outlet for converting datacard nos to prepaid card nos but eventually did not haPpen I had made ecess money on post paid nos which is bocked n u taking 60 days to refund
 The experience was good thanks to your staff Ms. Ramya . Pls continue this excellent service . Very professional, courteous and helpful .

 The Vodafone executive was not polite . And did not cooperate as expected..despite my continuous 10 years long relationship with vodafone co .
 Ok

 Service is very bad
 No one hears problems . Just like government offices from one table to another table !

 Problem not yet solved
 You have blocked my sim for 3 days but your employee helped me out .
 Behavior of associate was very rude
 laint registered was on 5th dec but till now not solved .
 Increase ur technical assistance avoid a long waiting in store
 Overall satisfactory
 Staff was cooperative but for overall impression, I would like to comment as... . 1. Chairs look stylish but they r not comfortable, secondly, in one to one communication both the chairs should be of same height and not adjustable, thirdly these chairs are uncomfortable especially for old people. . 2. Light music at background creates nice mood but some ****** instrumental music please try for it !! thanx for taking customers opinion
 All over it's good
 As it is a new store At nagawara still not yet opened but they have given good service I liked it thanks
 My mobile phone bill is so extra
 Time bahot lete he apke operator . We have to wait for long time even there is for table only two are present .
 1. I can't convert my post paid connection to prepaid connection in between bill cycle . 2. Vodafone has most pathetic services .
 Y
 Really Free solutions. . Very good I love Vodafone
 What ever our queries they answer n handle d prob with a smile n giving explanation . Fr d same good hospitality
 Waiting period was to long . When I went to the store, there was just one customer at each desk . Yet the resolution of their issue took more than half anhour . Also, I took a token as soon as I entered the store . My token no was 104. At that time I was the first in queue . After me two more customers came who did not take any token and just barged into any desk they chose and were immediately attended . Then what was the point of my taking a token and waiting for my turn . There was no security guard or usher to ensure that customers were attended in order of their tokens .
 It was quick and professional .
 Most worst service
 They missguide me, and gave me a new sim card to solve my problem but the problem is remain .
 Satisfactory but time promised to activate the sim was not appropriate
 There are very less number of agents in the store & as it is the only store @ my place it'll be always crowded . Next is to educate the agents with propertechnical knowledge to resolve the issues on spot instead of raising ticket or complaint number . After raising the complaint issue to be resolved with in 24 hrs suppose if it tower problem as more number of customers will be affected .
 Your service is very good but your assosiates behavior is not good .
 you people wont even reapond to thw coustamer properly . and dosent even care what problem he said
 Store associates are very cooperative
 We had a nice discussion . But follow up action on your end yielded nothing so far .
 Vodafone store help us every where & at any time
 I really don't like Vodafone stores and Vodafone services . Idea and other cellular companies gives us better services than you . There is not any proper and responsible person in your stores . We have to wait for a long for our turn always . And some response from your staff was very aggressively I wouldn'trecommend any others to go for Vodafone .
 Service was excellent . Executives are equipped with good communication skills . Overall my experience was great
 Poor experience
 Very good response and suport
 Services given by associate was awesome n he has shown the meaning of happy to help
 I like that executive
 Very sorry poor in customer relationship
 Good customer service
 The store associate does not pay the bills on time, not very well verse with the services provided.. . Always creates a prblm evry month.. .
 Front end staff is friendly and approachable .
 Not give service even no follow up as we r corporate client Club mahindra
 I gave less marks coz they told me. . U will get a call from customer care..but i didnt get any calll. . Thus my one prblm about 3G didnt get solve..its sad

 Vodaphone custmer care center is very bad service Its very very bad
 There was a token system in the store which was not being followed properly . So while I was asked to take a token people were going before me without tokens who cAme after me . After that the executive told me he couldn't help me but did not offer any solutions to my problem . Nor did he offer any options.When I asked him about a prepaid option . He told me as if he was a tape as to what would be required . It was like talking to an answering machine . Finally frustrated I walked out . Very impersonal experience . And not helpful at all .
 The reasons for my ratings r because service is prompt only waiting period five mins n my problem was solved immediately
 Nice experience . The Store Associate was quite (Monecca) was quite helpful and took time to explain about the new features of Vodafone and how it would benefit .
 I got my renewal sim in 2 min nd i dnt have to pay fr dis as i enter in store 3 to 4 people were around me ready to help me so dat was a nice exerience keep it up
 Voda is better than others . Executive are polite helpful . To convey my views and match with the hard and fast rules become difficult for them . Our feed b
 For the past 3 months my cheques deposited before due Dt at the Alipore Kolkata store have not been accepted . Every time my phone is disconnected sayingthat I have not paid the dues, which I have been doing unfailingly for last 14 yrs by cheque . As a very busy Doctor I find it very harassing . Even afterrepeated requests to the store personnel who are cordial & promise to get back but don't, I have not been given an explanation for the 'missing cheques'So the behaviour is good & welcoming but not followed up by any action . Next month The prospect of facing the same ignominy from 'Vodafone' is making methink about changing my service provider after 14 yrs
 Mr. Ranjan is a associate in your peeragarhi branch, he is nothing you are just wasting your time and money on him, he even dont know how to talk with the customer, I will take action against him
 Fast service

 I had to go to the vodafone store 4 times just for one same reason of getting a waviervof Rs.500. The behaviour of vodafone employee wasn't good
 The guy at counter was simultaneously attending other people, who had no token .
 Time consuming ,every one try to escape but lastly my problem was solved . I am old customer and senior citizen priority should be given .
 Good

 The waiting time is too long . It took me 45 minutes to get a chance to speak to the store associate . There is not enough seating space for people who arewaiting in the que . This should change
 Good service

 The executive did not helped me as committed by him and I had to follow up 3 times to get the SIM card activated . Expect vodafone executives to be more proactive . Quiet disappointed . Not all happy to help .

 For the first time I got a huge bill without using that much internet . People there helped me with my queries but I would only be satisfied if my amountof the bill is recredited to my account . Then only all the ratings stand some value .
 Good service
 Can't explain as nowhere near customer delight as got a feeling as though a customer is unwanted at the store . .. .
 when I activated 3G in my mobile for the first time on words am getting lost with the signals in the city itself
 Good service,nice network and much than any other network .
 NiCe
 Friendly, fast and advised rightly .
 Very disappointing billing process . No care of customers complain . Facing issue regarding reversal of money which is extra charged from last 3 month, yet
 Comments r - - - - - money deducted with no reasons to be refunded back . This will not only gain my faith as a customer but will spread message of voda help concern among all.otherwise ??????to say....... .

 My complaint has still not been resolved yet and that too I am a customer who ported his number to your network..... .
 Your associates have to improve their SERVICE to satisfy the customers .
 Your dealing executive ms.Priyanka was very helpful . No fuss with questions or apprehensions . Documentation made very easy with copying at show room itself .
 Internet regarding quiary , solve quickly in Vodafone store . Thanks to vodafone
 Weak network, staff says Vodafone has such service . Avoid call drops,
 They helped me to resolve my issue
 Things were done to my expectations . The only issue with the store was they are short staffed .
 Your staff especially mr.dinesh gave very good customer service
 David Raj was very nice,polite and helpful . After along time someone was nice @ your Chromepet Vodaphone Store to me, Even though I have been a loyal customer of Vodaphone for almost 10 years ! Counting.... .

 it was good
 Nobody known full information, they said I don't know to ask her/him and they don't know full tariff details . I am very bad and sad experience in yesterday store visit
 Kishan is good service provid bt pali new store manager is not good .
 I purchased a sim on Monday but still its not activated....i was misguided
 Polite & nice young man , patient and willing to genuinely listen customer without showing irritation
 Satisfied but long-waiting open some more stores in that vicinity
 Rude attitude . Not customer centric . Just there to complete formality . Non helping nature .
 Bad service & Vodafone staff is not capable to handle the customer complaints .
 Dear Sir / Madam, only my request is that to ur executive . From last 6 months to i am asking her to change my monthly bill cycle . All time she (RAHI) were saying, sir ** jayega . But not happened . This month also i put the request there . If this it won't be change then i think i should change the company.Regards - shankarsingh .
 I had to revisit the store covering a lot of distance, because the main work for which I had gone was simply forgotten by Vodafone people and it was onlyupon my revisit that I reminded them to look at the work .
 I gave a request for an Address Change way back on 1/11/2014. And even after multiple interaction with Customer Service and Store Representative my issue
 He friendly handel the customer. .
 The service is good
 It was good Experians cleared all doubts
 Wrong information was given....nano .sim stil nt activated because of goof ups...reallly unhappy
 Service is good n prompt n can b improved further
 They tried to solve problem of old & now Sr.Citizen customer .
 Good service
 I have registered a complaint regarding excess bill,there is no proper response till date, instead of doing these marketing strategies u can put this effort in solving customer issues / complaints
 SERVICE IS VERYGOOD
 I purchased a plan: Rs250 for calling and 5gb 3g unlimited data . I was told your services will be activated within 4 hours . I got charged more than 500 rupees overnight for data usage . Since then i have been visiting store, ringing them they said person u bought the plan from has left so they cant do anything . Simply ridiculous .
 Post ped std plan very costly other voda preperd plan .
 Attendant was friendly, patient, helpful, finally u have changed ur chairs n made ambiance pleasant n user friendly for all age groups . N rated 9 becausefew staff n token n turn system is verbal communication makes waiting time seem long .
 I had lost my mobile for which your representative gave me satisfactory guidance .
 Every thing is good .
 Vodafone is very gud network . I Like this very much but now i have faced many problems by this network so i want go to in any another network.. .
 Not bad .
 based on the interaction and visiting experience i gave these ratings
 Good
 Prompt response to my query to my satisfaction
 My purpose of getting a new sim card was served promptly.the people at d reception could b a little more welcoming.overall experience good.thanks .
 The atmosphere in store was so nice & a warm welcome from security guard when u step inn to the store . I was very much satisfied the way associate intracted with me & Simply its an awesome store.. !
 I am satisfied with your conversation.It may take time to give you the best score
 Very poor approach and coordination of staff and very little tech knowledge
 Good
 The person at the entrance was not sure abt my procedure but once I got a token no the guy at the counter was very helpful
 Long waiting period
 ment charges was applied due to this .
 MY FIRST EVER EXPERIENCE WITH V'fone . but the executives were very helpful and positive in resolving the problem . (NARESH & ABIMAAN) .
 1. Long unnecessary waiting hours even when the executives are sitting idle . 2. No one to guide the customers properly 3. Rude unwarranted behaviour
 Yes
 Staff are good....just not working through proper system
 Nice staff , quick service .
 All Customers should be regularly informed about new tariff plans when ever they are at your stores .
 Bcoz nthing is 100%
 Associates are excellent,but total Q system or slip system is very slow,at least 1 to 2 hours are in Q system in painful . More counter in required to solve the situation . Many customer leave during my visit only due to shortage of counter
 generally the experience was quite good . Some information had to be coaxed out
 No sitting arrengment for custmers
 Geetha explained very clearly explained all post paid packages.so, i taken post paid
 r i had a good experience , but now all has gone .
 Should entertain customer promptly
 r they asked for 100 rupee for duplicate sim y i need to pay so much . Option is there only for postpaid not for prepaid so i gave all zero
 Need to arrange some more seatings
 Thanks
 I am very satisfied

 arvice well & your internet cost is too costly I thing you should reduced the internet cost
 Only two customer was there when I was there in the store . .. But I need to wait for long time for my own turn...the staffs were talking each other making the customers waiting for long . That was a bad thing . There was more than 4 counters too .
 Good experience with Vodafone till now .
 Why should i pay full rentals instead of pro-rata for 4days to migrate 9916559393 from post to prepaid ?
 Unprofessional approach by the executives . Few Customers with later token number were attended before the ones waiting . To activate international roaming
 Not atall satsfied, very much time consuming. .
 They were very polite to help me
 M satisfied
 Vodafone network is outstanding . .. Without usage vodafone charged.. .

 Service good
 The cordiality and eagerness shown by your representative at your store to solve my problem
 The executives have no sense of respect for customers their behaviour is absolutely non tolerable , even the store manager is not bothered to come out and help customers . Need strict guidance over them to attest behave properly and the time consumed is too much
 No clarirty n docs required and no feedback or call updating connection status . Need to visit store to get feedback .

 Treatment of customer is good
 Yes, mY Vodfone is best in the whole World..Thank you VODAFONE
 The services of vodafone is always good but the representative (Piyush Jain) make it awesome whom i meet on the store he is well knowlegable and havinggood skills how to tackle problems with smile on the face .
 Very positive and helpful two staff members with whom I had to interact to address my request . I would specifically complement Miss Heena of the Store for her positive and helpful attitude . Thanks . I suggest two points to improve the service . Please provide additional seating arrangements for customers and provide waste paper bins both inside and outside the Store .
 I went ur Vodafone store . There is one Fat lady . She didn't give me right answer . When I asked her abour manager or Supervisor she told me that no one ishere . Do whatever u want to do.I went ur Vodafone store . There is one Fat lady . She didn't give me right answer . When I asked her abour manager or Supervisor she told me that no one ishere .

 Q 07
 It was fast & efficient service .
 I am satisfied. . Overall good service
 Change of SIM and activation was done very quickly . May be if the centre was bit clean it would have enhanced the experience .
 The services provided 2 the coustermer by t asocites is very best . Wel done vodaphone. . :)
 My company 's CUG lines were cut for no fault of ours.The response from your Mr.chandrakumar was arrogant asking us to provide Bank Statement as proof . Tcompany is Mudhra Fine Blanc Private Limited.Chennai . Let me see your response .
 I went voda store to exchange my sim . They told me dat my new micro sim will be activated in next 2 hrs but till dis moment its not activated .

 Good
 Assosiates were not able to provide a working sim . They had to change sim thrice to bring it to working condition . Which means i had to go there two times extra and after port in my number remained off for full day . My day was spoiled .
 Fine and helpful
 ent the customers for there work that means they exchanged the papers with customers only they simply sat on the seat .
 All staffs were co-operative . Their way of communication was excellent .
 Ur staff waz v.cooperative n helpful.they had good skills n well mannered.expecting da same to b continued in future.v need a direct number to speak to da customer care through our mobiles as reaching da office everytime z not possible n feel irritated b listining to ur saved msgs n keep typing da number123.....n all.doesnt matter its chargable bt ther shud b a direct no for any help .
 The advisor "Tapas" at the store was absolutely arrogant and my issue was not addressed.. . There wasn't any " Happy to Help" attitude which is actually required
 I am very greatfull to gaurav he helped
 Everything was good .
 Just super .
 Your staff is knowledgeable and quick to reply to queries .
 Good
 Way of approach with customer is good . satified with their reply .
 I had always been with Vodafone for no false billing and service . Which it had never ever failed me .

 Great experience with vodafone .
 The vodafone network is actually good than others ...I really enjoying and thank you once again
 Good service. .
 Reasons stated above . Pl see carefully . If yr system is under repair / upgrade , you should inform customers, dont fool them .
 0 if there is minus rating I would rate it -9
 When we applied for postpaid to prepaid we had to wait for over a month ..and the bill was raised for that period . Even after personal visits he didn'tdid anything and later says it was due to some .missing signature..really a bad experience...i (we) hope to switch for some better network..lost faith in
 Reduce waiting time.. . :)
 Need more pleasant staff
 Its good need to be more better
 If I called to customer care and give complaint but they are not take my request then I went to store ask my detail but they told that there is no info
 Kindly resolve the issues

 Very satisfied
 O
 I feel my problem of finding one damaged digit in recharge coupon could have been resolved on phone or internet . I was told that my problem could be resolved only if I visit Vodafone store
 people advised me not to go for it and instead convinced me to opt for a more suitable plan . Thanks .
 e..but not a single time positive action has been taken on my cimplaints .
 Hopeless
 very satisfied
 ains in resolved .
 Waiting time . Most of d counters not working . No well managed queue . No desk for priority customer . Executive mostly busy with new connections . Not sufficient place to sit n wait . Didn't find d store manager cabin or signage . One counter was for priority customer but you will hardly find there . Finally doa mystery shopping and you will believe all the above noted points . No regrets for lady who attained she was perfectly ok in her job . Overall store was
 Obviously the Mini Store that I visit is nice & well cleaned . The service is also good and the CCE is also well mannered and friendly with customer .
 10 very satisfied
 In my point of view vodafone executive is very frndly & provide me instant solution which cutomers wants/expected frm vodafone .
 i was having some problem with my sim for few days.So i visited to Vodafone store nearby . They just not only fixed my problem well and fast but also solved my related queries
 The executive was not interested to help . I had to show some aggression to get him to help me
 Major name change procedure in vodafone account should be made easier, Vodafone ahud only ask for newspaper ads and affidavit (and one new ID and addressproof if neccessary) like the passport authority, and nothing more .
 Fast response
 When i entered the store i was greeted with a smile and was promptly attended was given priority of senior citizen and when my turn came the person listened to me carefully and patiently and solved my quarries to my greatest satisfaction
 Look at my last bill for the month of November. . I had visited Vodafone store 5 times since then. . Mr. Chaitanya Manjrekar (peninsula office at Lower Parel) has assured me of the reversals of my data usage of Rs . 6025 which I have never used. . I had complained via email via helpline but nothing till nowhas been done . This is my last effort or else I am going to file the case in consumer court & also claim the compensations for harassing 10 year old loyal customer. . You guys shud learn solving genuine problems. . I have already mentioned to escalate the issue to the highest level & inquire into the complete matter but yet there is no word from Vodafone at all. . Everytime I went to the store Mr. Chaitanya has assured me of my reversals but I am still waiting. .
 I won't say much you guys know how to attend ur customers
 I cant message my experience with Vodafone, please feel free to call me and know the problem what a customer is facing .
 Good approach and understanding approach to customers ** CMA.TCAS Prasad
 Need to do some more
 t nt bothered
 I asked for recharge slip & he called the Security Guard on me & I'm 70 years . I was being treated like I was a terrorist when all I asked was for recharge slip which should be kept on the counter .
 Very unlikely
 Prompt action regarding the problem & try to solve the issue is to be appreciated . Quick response I like it . Please solve my unexpected high bill . Thanks .
 Very Satisfied
 As it was very helpful and quick process
 Though I recommend vodafone to others, I am disappointed that vodafone network cant support iPhone for 2g or 3g! Moreover when I allpied for the number Iwas also not informed about this by your agents (I did tell them that I use iPhone and need nano SIM, still I was not warned)
 I believe that there is scope for improvement
 Excellent
 Don't be exaggerated by my rating, it is because one of your staff by name Mr Chandrakanth who has helped me to solve my problem . Even in spite of remitting the bill on 25th November 2014 and in spite of my complaint at your Vodafone shop and subsequent mail from your shop probably landed in your dustbin.So far even today my mobile account has not been credited by Rs 545 and I am getting reminders daily in my mobile as well as non payment enquiry from your recovery cell . This has resulted me, thinking to switchover to other service providers, for inordinate delay and anxiety caused to me will fetch you zero mark . Hope, the problem will be solved immediately on TOP PRIORITY.
 Educate the store guys what customers service is . Hire people who know what manners
 007E25CE003A002D007D003A002D0040
 The guy told me the procedure . Actually your policies are and procedures are good and hence the high rating .
 The service provided is excellent . Either when v call to a customer care or visit a gallery . Just one request, whenever v call for assitance there shouldb a option to speak directly to an executive . Thanks
 Please call me

 Hi , Its been around two weeks I'm using Vodafone. . Everything is good till date like Range and 3G network. . Just do the address verification for my bothnumbers 9004872844 & 9004166474 at the earliest . Its causing me hell lot of trouble! ! And kindly don't stop my outgoing facility for both the numbers inany case, as Il be out of town till 15th dec Thank you !! Regards, Naren R Kulkarni
 It was over crowded, took too long, Shanti the customer service person insisted I show her my original pan, despite my having credit cards, club cards and a colour copy of my Pan and a driving license receipt . All of this just to get a nano sim for a number that has been mine for 20 years ! Your service isridiculously bad . I have an RM but this I had to do on my own . There were so many people complaining about wrong billing it was not funny ! Vodafone wasgood now service levels are abysmally bad
 You waste your client number of hours, take security for International Roaming of 9000/_ and still don't start it . Shame on you .
 The exe.who attended me acted as he said
 Excellent service
 Execitive doing exelent work nd provide best service
 The experience is truly helpful * wonderful without doubt
 I am very disapointed
 nknown date of resolution . I was asked to come back to the store exactly on 24th billing date.... .

 I recd the required inf .And they explained it very well & polietly .
 The executive over there dint know only the procedure well...her reasons for not solving my query were changing again and again and it felt like shes intquery was a senior only So what if i would hav talked one mor time ? Would it have hurt ? I had to the gallery so i might as well would have talked to thesenior also right. . Really disappointed in your service
 I stil didnt get any solution for my problm. . I visited the store . I also called customer care for 4 times . But stil the issue has not been solved .
 I really like the way the agent handled my queries and processed my paperwork to ensure I wouldn't have to come again . She did a fab job . U guys should hire more people like her
 Rude, unhelpful.. . Was promised resolution by end of day . Did not resolve or communicate...pathetic treatment of customers. .
 The queues are very very long..apart from that it is a good experience
 Dear Mr. Yesterday I have joined your additional new postpaid line, but till now you have not connect that new line . I can't understand your service provided for us . Thank you .
 Mr. Rahul's handling and solving of problems were excellent
 Inspite of submitting all required papers n proofs my outgoing calls were obstructed causing immense tension . Thats bcoz d proof of payments were not updated in d vodafone store . Several calls went unheeded . After wasting 2 hrs on d first visit the second visit i again had to wait more than 1 hr b4 i wascalled . This is not done .
 Ok now since you asked let me explain . Firstly we are almost Senior Citizens & we had to wait 40 mins to be entertained . Next this is the 3rd or 4th timethis mix up is happening by your call centre . And finally to avoid later harassment from your agents we are forced to go to through this procedure . Justfor yr info I have 8 post paid lines & 1 prepaid line . Adrian Pereira
 Iam noe a days very unsatify parson b's your signle are poor hence internet use is very headeque for me . I have complained earlier but no improvement in
 Your customer care officers are sitting idle & not attending customers who are waiting in the queue.They should give respect the time of the client's asevery bodies time is precious .
 I'll rank it from 0 to 10 .. . I'll give it an 8 out of 10
 After one hour search in computer they are not able to tell me the details of Rs . 1850 levied in my last bill
 B-)
 I do not get my bill to my email, the tarrif is also too high compared to prepaid
 After the repeated unsatisfactory response to my emails frm customer care, the service experience at the shop was good .
 Net problem u r staff told me that u r net will start after 6 hour now it more then six hour so were is my net
 No comment.. .
 To improve your service level and best offers given to customers
 Very first responce with the scence of essentiality .
 Token sheets exhausted, communication skills needs 2 b improved
 Vodafone is very nice company but whenever we need to talk to you very less it was connected otherwise it is a good experience
 I have given a complint. . But your costemer servicers are not ready to solve my complint . So i would like to leave my number from vodafone .

 Our My experience of earlier visit to churchgate store was not good . I applied for port of my bsnl mobile to vodafone with all documents and fee . Despitemy visit twice to store, I could not know reasons for not porting my no . However, my experience of last visit 2 days ago for some other work was satisfactory .
 ing the complaints with out solving .
 Firstly I would advise your staff to cooperate customers in friendly way, so that it help us to convey our problems easily
 Very prompt and to the point service
 Very good .
 way of talking of executives ,lac of information ,hidden charges . like excess usage but no informations about the same etc .
 Worst experience with international Vodafone co.......ur employees treated like they doing govt job.. .
 No Comment
 They are very humble and cooperative
 We have held the SIM since 2007 and apparently the verification details have been overwritten with someone else's . The staff had no clue on the issue orthe system . The "manager" did not bother to come and discuss despite the requests by the store associate . The responses were completely lame .
 It was a wonderful experience over all .
 not at all customer friendly
 10 very satisfied
 Worst experience
 One mark cut on all ratings as the store did not hold usb cables to transfer data.... .
 V_e'ry nice service
 Your company is thef
 Your stores are very helpful but your Vodafone service is disgusting
 Very nice
 Very gud service
 It was all good experience visiting the Vodafone store,the thing I would like to comment is the technical supports and the order of appointment was not so effective it was random process and may cause chaos and fights

 I am not satisfied because my problem was not solved
 V wnt to b updated regarding d plans.sm kind of schemes...proper guidance for d plans to select according to d requirement.thnx
 The reason for going to store was silly
 Vodafone support team is very corporative.. .
 I'm loving it
 There is no proper response frm u people n I'm totally not satisfied with your service
 Only missing part is insufficient sitting place . Rest is on the level of 7-8
 Services they had given to me
 Not good data service . Very slow

 Nothing to say good about Vodafone customer services .
 It was a good experiennce .
 When we are PORTING from other networks you will provide good offers but never somedays why you are not giving the some offers . So you are attracting newcause for spending huge amount of money to advertisements are not important compare to an old customers promotion, old customers will tell other that from last 5 years i am using vodafone, they are providing good plans compare to others.. . I done that types of promotions, but finally you also doing same things like others . So its my suggest.. . Thank you for your service.. .
 It's was a good experience and hope I get the same in services too as I am a new customer of Vodafone and I wish Vodafone provides me good services and q
 Good experience . Super Service .
 Some of employee are irresponsible about there work that's why people's are sad when they have to Visit Store for same Problem .
 us associate blame her for being faulty . What kind of employee u have . They all try to blame each odr .
 I visited Vodafone store at Prabhadevi, Mumbai on 5th dec 2014 and I am extremely disappointed with the way Ms.Rageshree Morye handled my complaint . Shewas not only rude but also displayed utmost arrogance and ignorance while dealing with my query . She was joined by the worst behaved Ms.Sarika Mishra whoscreamed at me and even kept on laughing at me incessantly . I have never been more humiliated than because of that incident which has left a huge negative impression of Vodafone on me . I would like you to take stringent action against the two above mentioned customer service executives and also drastically improve the services offered to customers who visit stores out of their own circle . I feel I was rejected because I visited a Mumbai store though Ihave a Maharashtra Goa vodafone number . This kind of discrimination is truly uncalled for .
 My request was attended to promptly . The staff was extremely helpful and courteous . Overall experience in store was pleasant .
 I didnt get the help and the info i wanted,the storekeepers didnt help me
 Its a very warm experiance and very helpfull
 o be resolved .
 Rajeshawri was very help ful she taken my complaint in 2 min i just had to wait only 2 min
 Prompt service
 only 1counter is there for more than 100 customers . that is very rude and unprofessional too
 I like your fast servise but chota credit is not respons in my mobile can you help me any time ?
 Very friendly and helpful .
 M happy with ur service thank you
 Though fed with replies from ur other store, I was pleased by replies from ttk road vodfone store reps, thanks for them .
 good service
 .... . So inform them to give proper responsible answer to the customers... .
 Vodafone making fraud .by giving criminal used number and harassment by cops ... . Tc
 In Vodafone store you should look how you can minimise the waiting time of the customers .
 TUSHAR is very experienced in handling objection . He has given me right suggestions for choosing appropriate plans .
 worst service
 Lack of experience & never mind oF customer satisfication
 Awesome store
 Very bad service no addecate to ur call centre manager
 Though the interaction was good, but after talking to your customer care over telephone.. . I m very much confused . All statements are contradictory to each other .
 The service was quick and the good motive to the cm
 the staff was not trained to open the htc mobile to examine the sim card.The sim was used in a Nopkia phone and shifted to htc phone . were not gettingWe were getting connected to vodophopne signal .
 Happy service
 Back office process has to be quick
 Staff is not concerned about customer and doing their job slowly and roaming here and there in store, making themselves busy in their own style . I askedfor a change of sim from prepaid to postpaid . But reply is not satisfactory
 Good
 It was nice and i like that we have vodofone store in over area
 Counter staff not very helpful . Thks
 Awasm service
 Services very good & useful to society at large . Thanks
 Your store associate quickly solve my problem and i hope my pending request related to vodafone to vodafone free number will be solved soon
 I went on sunday to get my sim replacement done but the executive said that they cannot process the request as it is sunday and asked to come on monday.When went on monday they made me stamme for a long time . Executives response is also not good
 a kind of service which I never experienced before... .
 1) staff is inexperience and irresponsible . 2) they taking 20-50 minutes to attend single customer . 3) if anyone has took token, he has to wait for atleast 2-3 hours for *** numbet to *** . 4) staff has very less knowledge of the product, solution to queries of customer . They misguide the customers, due towhich customer has to come again and again for same query 5) people arevwaiting for hours and hours for their number to come after taking token, and most og time staff attending the customer who come directly wothout any token . 6) customers have to stand 2-3 hours, no proper sitting arrangement .
 Good coverage friendly service nice to meet your stores
 Just raising complaint is not enough . We can do it on internet also . Getting resolution on the spot is important
 Parking problem, heavy traffic
 I'm associated with you over a decade because of transparency quality of service and customer friendly scheme
 My reply is clear; no service provided: complaint Not resolved; the lady attending to me doesnot know mobile plans and other info; she was confused ! Really pathetic ! I am thinking switching iver to other service provider . I asked for mgr thr, but i was told he had gone for meeting .
 rotate around Vodafone store for activation. .
 Got the job done to my satisfaction

 Its easy smooth n systematic
 No heed is paid to customer queries and complaints . Worst experience of my life
 My problem is not solved yet my Internet is on 2G and i am paying for 3G
 The members of the store were very well-behaved, co-operative, and the whole procedure was very much user friendly.They are really "HAPPY TO HELP"
 Happy to help
 Coz I got the service I required without any problem and your associate interact with me friendly and help me to solve my issue at the earliest . Thank u
 Superb store .
 A good responce
 Store staff are not cooperative(Majeed) and there is no process to distinguish between loyal, regular customers and one time visitors at ur store
 The officials r very friendly and helpfulnd courtious nd vodafone offfers plenty of services . Great connectivity
 Good service....pls arrange seating for your customer....:(
 The service of your call centre and all departments associated with it is extremely poor The staff blatantly lies and is completely unreliable For goodfaithful customers you should hv a separate team relating to them
 Waiting time was long even the executive not attending any cudtomer....he was just busy in his own work . I also did nt get satisfactory answers from his query .
 Very good overall experience , response, explanation & use technology .
 Before asking better at least train your representive to behave with Costmer due to hub I am changing my two year old postpaid to prepaid
 Excellent service
 Very good service
 I am suffering frm credit limit plz increase
 The contents of my rating is large for text message
 Due to shortage of staff the waiting period in min 1hr and the store gets crowded .Due to which the store gets crowded with people nd limited sitting place
 I was happy with d overall interaction at the store
 Pls spread the vodafone store as much as you can & most of all spread the counter
 I being in a service provider Industry I felt that it could be improved substantialy
 Long waiting pdriods, unresponsive staff
 Good
 When I have a problem in my bill the store person is asking to call the help desk . So I advise to close all stores .
 Your staff does not have answers to queries .. . Your connectivity is bad ... . Your internet is expensive n very very slow
 You didn't clearify anything what can we do . Firstly say something nd another moment say other thing
 Nice interaction,quick action,systematic,quality of work is good .
 Very high phone bills and less out calls
 tel y that happend .
 Didn't have to wait long.Staff was courteous,helpful and knowledgeable
 Complain jldi solve nhi hoti h
 Near to my store technical knowledge should be improved some
 I port from idea for prepaid with clear dicussion as I HAVE VISSON DIFFICULTY I SIGNED PAPERS WHICH WERE GIVEN, Afterward during varification I knew itwas migrated in postpaid ! Inspite REPETED VISIT & REQUEST NO RESULT TILL DAY
 Your persons gives fake commitments 3 times
 roming incoming calls not servise activat
 She so helpful&Kind and awsum experience in ur store . Her name was aruna
 Firstly even though it was 11:30 am but only one counter A was working . Then after 5-10min lady came and said someone will address your query shortly ande forgot to forward request for activation . How ridiculous is this . First the miss and second the procedure that you buy sim separately and request for athen guys came . Store timings are from 10:30 but no one on desk . I asked for normal sim but that was not available . Quite strange you don't keep normalsim . Then I got new sim and was told it will be activated soon max 2 hours . But it didn't till 3 hours . Then u called cc and came to know the guy in storctivation is separate
 The store associate was able to provide appropriate information about my queries and the services offered were satisfactory .
 Hardworking and helpfulness of the store associate .
 Good services
 Gud behaviour
 My un billed amount was -37. But you add 160. Rs for only 2 days.. . My rental . 149. Your executive told me pls come on 8 dec . you have to pay only 0 rs... .
 I went for SIM replacement . Today 3rd day . My new SIM is still not working .
 Very nice
 Overall good
 Quick service
 Ok
 Need to wait for long time . No persons in all counters .
 Apke store par jo employes hai vo castomer ko priped se postpaid mai canvord karne k liye une pripaid sim nahi dete or 10 bar chakkar lagvate hai agra k7 store par mujhe kisi ne pripaid sim nahi diya tha isi liye ok
 The interaction was good
 She who helped me was very supportive and friendly . She gave me instruction precisely what documents are required and processed very smoothly . She was professional .
 For an existing long subscribing post paid customer, the paper work needed can be substantially reduced .
 I gave application to your porur vod store for name transfer on 5/12/14.But till today there is no proper response and your people also insist me notto use outgoing calls till they transfer the name process . So i got totaly upset and also now i think about portability .
 1 last time I had to go three times to get microchip exchange . They were telling me that my connection is limited company, it is private investment company owned by me & my wife . They wanted letter head, letter signed by authorised signatories etc . 2 I did not carry any document this time also but they took my photo and I forwarded my address proof through mail . 3 as a senior citizen I was called in seconds .
 Call back
 Kindly improve your store services .
 It's the overall environment of the store, dissatisfaction is all around .
 Everyone helps me .
 't get any reply from them.I had to wait from 11am to 2 pm to solve my complaint .
 Satisfy my problem
 Ihordinate delay in processes
 Am happy visiting this store, I'd like to continue as a Vodafone's customer, thank you
 Very poor response to complain .. . Poor managment ... . Very very bad in handling
 Very Good experience....... .

 The customer care official was polite but distracted . The computer was slow so couldn't view my bill . So one query was resolved and another wasn't . The cco was to call me back but didn't .

 The store didn't even have a photocopier for add proof copies . One has to go out and get copies themselves .
 Store help very nicely
 The store associate should not behave like a machine . A humane approach is expected .
 Worst response, Improper behaviour, Misguides the customer and making fun of customer .
 ore customers and they treat customers like they are doing some favour to the customers .
 Very Good
 First teach ur store associates how to interact with people and to solve their problems . They are soo negligent
 Our problems cleared quickly .

 Good service but complicated verification procedure
 Just to replace my sim card it took 1.30 hrs . at the store, there was actute shortage of man power at the store
 Good service
 Your network coverage is poor where I am leaving
 Network at my place is very bad . When I drop at your store for making my bill payment there is always a tug of war between cash and card payments along with system down term .
 Your associate Mr. OmPrakash was extremely courteous & helpful & did all my work quickly & efficiently . Please Thank him from me for excellent service .
 Experience is so so nd vodafone service too
 The executives need to consider every1s time . Just because u know some1 at the store you breach order of the token . The lady knew chesta and himanshu ofthe store at preset vihar

 I was not very happy waiting as I had to wait for almost 40 minutes before I could see a representative but I was happy with his response as he was ableto help me with all my concerns .
 For not helping me properly .
 Kindly improve your services . ...so there is no constant queue at your stores . .....I waited 40 mins for my turn,that too at 3:40pm .

 The service of Vodafone are pathetic . You have lost a sincere client
 The store was a good experience

 Speed and correct understanding of what I required
 Store associate Ashish at sector 15 Faridabad was very helpful . He was very patient with me and solved all my queries . All these 10 points are for him .
 Senseless procedures in place...pointless visit to the store .
 The associate was very helpful and solved my issue promptly
 o any problem . They asked to visit the store again & again . This has been the most horrible experience with vodafone . All I needed was a micro sim prepaid with a 3G plan which took 2 times store visit & 5 customer care calls . I will never recommend vodafone anyone else .
 The lady who was handling my problem understood and tried to help .
 Pls listen to my call which you recorded yesterday . You r definitely a confused lot and definitely not ready to help
 Very bad .

 Your head office brach which located on UIT Circle is awesome in working . Their staff members are also superb . 10/10 rating for them . But your Surajpole branch is third class . Their behaviour is also **** . I ask something& they give answer of another question . When i go next then they treat like i am coming their in first time . So please improve the staff member's skill of Surajpole office . They have not achieve the rating of 2/10. But your head office branch staff is superb . Their attitude, behaviour etc . are best .
 Because i m satisfied in your service
 More transparency is essential for Customer

 Vodafone does not want to do the right things.. . they penalise the customer for their oen good.. . I have been a loyal customer of vodafone from 2006 andI have 5 numbers in total for my family from ages and now we think of using mobile portability. . its high time for tolerance .
 Totally dissatisfied
 Every one listen properly and give solution for our problem i love it
 The problem that I am facing is still not solved,some of your regulations and policies are so annoying
 Q.5
 .your staff helped and my problem is solved
 Your service is very poor . i have visited 6-7 times in ur Girish Park branch, but the result is still pending . us stafs behaviour is very pathetic .
 All good genuine customers are asked to take token and wait in queue while some of your store associates entertain their friends or known customers witho
 It was satisfying and assuring
 Very long waiting period with over-worked store associates .
 The VODAFONE Perons is neet and lovely
 Services are provided to good but over satisfactory attitude of premium customer( too older) just like BSNL.
 Firstly you guys should start hiring people that are responsible enough to handle these jobs. . I visited the Vodafone store on 3rd Dec to get my prepaidconnection changed into a postpaid one. . The activation period which your associate told me was 48 hrs. . After 3 days I called at the store. . I got no reply. . On 8th Dec when I finally visited the store again. . I waited for 40 mins for my turn and later was told that the service could not be provided dueto request not been forwarded. . They even lost my I'd proof copies and the form. . Really was a terrible experience. .
 Good response and cleared my doubts.. .
 Good service professional n helpful executive
 Good staff
 I allrey a old costomer to vodaphone prepaid . So i started our working at state leavel for advertising . I needed a postpaid plane it's use sms . Internet .&local or few std call's . So working progress & changed the old trend's . Ok g/n . ashokkumarmzn011@gmail.com
 I didn't request any data plan to active in my number, so how can u do that . Is running from August month but I don't know,till November . 4month I pay ufor that
 The reason i rated 0 for all the questions is your employees aren't punctual because of them i waited 1 hour and 36 minutes and after that she talked with me in an arrogant manner and at last told me to pay 330 ruppees even my unbilled amount was just 134 ruppees...damn !! ! India is number third in population in the world so next time choose the correct one cause there are many unemployed and skillful person beside you.. . Thank you and the most importantthing you used to say happy to help but your employees aren't feeling so...!! ! Thank you
 I went to your store to change my address and that is done but I also want knw about your red plan but I dnt got proper information also their working format is very Slow which take atlest 40 to 50 min . Overall 5
 n couples seconds . Hats off for such employees .
 nk you.. .
 they do not even bother about thier customer's concerns. .
 gud . i am happy ur maitenance
 I stepped in for a micro sim and stepped out with the sim in minutes . I was helped to put the sim in my new phone . I was told 2 hours for activation butit took just around 30 minutes
 Its getting delayed standing for a ong time . Service provided was good .

 Service and overall everything was good
 Biggest problem we are facing here is with the network fluctuations due to network switching from vodafone to airtel for 3g. Which results in call dropsand regular fall in connectivity .
 A counter good
 Given suggestion many times in vashi gallery.. . nobody is interested to look into it... . if u r interested ... . get back to me
 I love Vodafone
 Excelent

 Smooth, fast and hassle free !

 (Very satisfied) 9
 I came at 10 am & store opened exactly on time . The man at the entrance respectfully asked me to sit & helped in taking the token . The store associate quickly grasped what I wanted & helped in my choice . Instead of asking me to go to cash counter he himself did everything . And quick also .
 This is my continued complaints but it goes in waste paper basket, there's no responsible person with whom I can contact
 You are very help full
 Customer reps not trained adequately . No initiative to help solve problems . Incorrect billing .. Too many issues .
 1 0
 U need to mke urself more customer friendly and flexible as per customer needs and requirements.u people r xtremely rigid and unhelpfull. .
 I had to wait for one hour before my turn came Place is I inadequately staffed . I wanted some change in plan for which I am expected to send an e mail . Why can not it be done on spot that too after waiting for one hour . Payment could not be made as card machine was not working . Trust you will agree it isnot a pleasant experience . Moreover overheard other users talking of errors in billing particularly changing for internet when one has not subscribed toit . In my case too I have been charged for net when I not using at all
 Very satisfied
 I was satisfied with the executive's (Jeffery) help to resolve my issues i
 Very nice
 I found most of the Vodafone Stores I visited does not have proper cool air in spite of air conditioners .

 Service is verygood,nyc customer handling,polite. .
 As per the intraction with executive
 Its always been a great experience at the southern avenue branch
 revisit Vodafone store for something that is not my mistake . Finally your store was not open at the right time . I had to wait after travelling some distance in the morning .
 I have requested to change my existing plan after present Bill cycle but it has been changed today itself which is something impractical and undesirable.moreover internet connection also discontinued
 Good
 There are very helpfull. .
 ly in a hurry .
 Both service and employees are excellent
 I think in this outlet no one serious about their job and they also need to learn coustomer service and meaning of coustomer service spacially MR RAHUL,i don't know the full name but i requested him to convert my postpaid no . into prepaid because of service of my no . is blocked without any notice and i.e . after the 10 to 15 days of activaction of my postpaid no . I ask him to check it out almost 60 days ago and finally today i.e . 8th of dec . i got the result . I don't think this is what yor are the guys are working for and this is the coustomer satisfaction .
 steal money I hope your company is liquidated
 Store is very good but the customer service people is not good , because I am meet cashair to solve my issue I saw there some staff in help desk but no one not carrying

 The customer service agent told me to get a id proof and add proof of my mother and mine earlier and also my original id Today, they asked for my mothersoriginal id also . I had to run all the way back home to get it and when I returned, he didn't evn invite me to his desk, just told me to leave the xeroxcopy of my mothers id proof there , saw my momz oroginal id, didn't even bothered to ask for my id . If they don't need my id, then why would they ask meto get it ? The customer service agent did not tel me when the services will be stopped and no other information was given . And on asking , he was rude . I have been using vodafone since 6 years but this experience was not at all appreciable
 The service was very slow at first I was said that the activation will happen by just 3 hrs but it took 30hrs for activation I was not at all informed ab
 I had deactivated my Blackberry plan twice in a months span calling the helpline and have shown the msg recd to your store associate Israr, but it's still active and got my current bill including same .

Shall be obliged if you can do the needful and help me out by deactivating my earlier blackberry plan since now I have activated 3G plan on my new iPhone and it's of no use for just paying you for not using the Blackberry plan . Urnest rqst to kindly deactivate same and give the reimbursement soonest .

 I had very bad experience with the service... . bcz without my consent (permission) activation is done from yourside . kindly find the my service registration number 1630522264.
 Each time that I have visited the place . Received a warm welcome and my problems were Urgently resolved . The Salt Lake City office is really very proactive
 Although u have made a fantastic looking and inviting store . You need to work on customer management . Some staff following queues, some not .
 Being a foreigner got a very bad experience from Vodafone from the very first day of the activation of this connection . Paid for 3G service last 2 days back but yet to activated the service . Went to customer service, not seen any discipline over there . My serial no was 131 but they were serving 132. Attitude of the customer service representative was so poor even I can't describe that . However, I will never recommend anyone to take Vodafone whenever any of my F&F visit in kolkata .
 The explanation given by your Vodafone store executive was not so complete .

 Yesterday i bought this new connection with vodafone for my phone and visited the vodafone store (for a better service)rather than any retailer , which is quite far from my place and i showed them my fone for which i wanted the sim but i was given the sim of a wrong size for which i had to come again causing me mental and monetary inconvenience
 Very good And nice service
 The vodafone executive was supportive and polite .

 Yestderday i was cheated by the vodafone . In my 5years experience yesterday's experience was the worst one.yesterday my sim's registeration was failed due to unknowing reason & i request voda store to restart it . But they put the condition that the no will be restarted only if it is converted to postpaid.Although the sim was purchased from the vodafone store itself . & one more problem i faced is that i had submitted my documents named sagar jain but my n

 Store sales people do not have the decency to talk and I did not get the plan I wanted . Pathetic .
 Yesterday I paid visit to your store for complaining roaming charges after passing Kalyan as it should not . Your representative agree with me & he notedon the computer, assured me that within 4 Hrs problem will be solved . But it is regret to say that the same is created after passing Kalyan . Will I get roaming charges in my post paid bill ?
 A big network store functioning with printer without cadridge and there will be no hand receipt book for the past one week..the staves are feared about manager..they told . HOW CUSTOMER PAY WITHOUT RECEIPT...BUT THE CUSTOMECARE CALLED SOMANY TIMES FOR PAYMENT..BEFORE DUE DATE? IS IT YOUR POLICY?
 Completely unhelpful and slow . Wasn't happy . Used to trust Vodafone a lot
 Mr Vishal Aggarwal, holds the best knowledge and Zeal to customer centricity and Descision making responsible ability.. . Wish him the best..! !
 Proper information not provided by staff
 No commitments fulfilled, services deactivated by me still activated, i will not pay any charges against these services.. .

 All queries excellently replied and job done instantly
 Generally service is good . but many times interuption by asking music download,cancelation of call after initialy hearing ringing of dialed number are alittle disatisfying .
 Worse service
 I visited Vodafone store last week on Saturday to open new prepaid account . The representative named Jogendra didn't explain well and was very rude to meg 7 hours . I think we need to be more efficient to become competitive in current market .
 Good store hissar
 Its been more than 24 hrs and my issue remains unresolved
 Great service by each and everyone in the store . I'm very happy . Thanks .

 pital and the lady sitting right top most corner !! Dissatisfied by 2 known customers

When I made noise that it was their fault n I was suffering - he checked my documents told me to go home and bring my husbanuld receive it within 24 to 48 hours but I never got it . Since I have to travel I rushed to your JMD Ggn office . There Mr Loknath refused to help givingd's letter on Monday or he would never do it . My husband spoke to him over the phone but he rudely refused and sat at another desk . Another officer Mr. Abhishek too replied ditto but when I gave a name of a top Vodafone man - he helped me by sending a nano sim at my home while I was still there only . That
 Staff was conviniently nice and respectful...and vodafone as a brand we expect this kind of level maintained n hope its stays n improves further more cozmy few past experiences were very bad in terms of 3G services n staff interactions
 The ambience was good over there . I found it friendly and ready to help .
 For a change of address your executive asked for original lease agreement . I provided her a photocopy of the same . Original is with landlord and he is no
 Experience with the store associate was good but the problem with raichur store is that the customers go directly to the associate without following anyorder or que . People with manners who wait for their turn will never get a chance to meet the store associate until they too follow the norms of the mann
 Vodafone is best

 Superbub
 for best service
 Extremely unresponsive and not helpful... . Have provided details in the feedback form at the store
 It was quick and customer friendly procedure . Staff was helpful .
 The store was very crowded, and had sesting for just 6 people . The rest of us had to stand for close to an hour . There were several elderly customers, but they got no help on generating tokens - I did it for a few of them . Too many customers, and too few attendants . This has been the case for the last fewyears, so Vodafone needs to work on this asap!Seating*
 Simply superb
 Very poor response.they wont bother about customer satisfaction.Totally feel bad about the store .
 Inconsistent policy for renewing blocked sim & impolite custmr care
 Getting Vodafone signal is real issue now days ..3G service is also not upto the mark ..
 For one purpose i have visited 5 times to the Vodafone store,& co operations from the employees are poor also .
 Nice experience with ur executive ms.jenifer . she is helping me lot . ... .
 I must like vodafone service because of the network coverage.you must send every coustomer some awareness about save water,tree plantation . THANK YOU
 ..we come to your gallery for solution...please check how u people have given me wrong plans everytime...i m disappointed .

 This was my fifth vist for the store with the same complaint but still now I dint get the proper solution for my complaint . The store associates were noteven ready to listen my complaint felt very bad sorry to comment like this... .
 ated yet . And im unable to contact the customer care
 I feel the service and guidance by the associates are really good and give full attention and clear view for the goods whch needs to be purchased
 I am not satisfied Vodafone service . Very worst service . Totally disappointed i felt why I selected this provider .
 its wellknow
 My main purpose of visiting store was to get data transferred from my old phone to new phone (iPhone 6plus) which could not be done inspire of store bein
 I visited first time . It was satisfactory
 Firstly i had a network problem and u people solved it very lately . So i would like to tell u to solve the problem asap .
 Your Xerox machine was not working and I got to know that it was not working from one week . I had to go out for the Xerox . Is this the customer service?Then there was a customer who complained about the server being down from the past 10 days and he was told to go to South ex Vodafone store . I mean thisis really not done . If there is a problem then we find a solution to it and not tell alternative for that . Rest was okay . Thanks
 They didnot tell me earlier about booster plan charge exorbitant bill and now said we will not help you
 Internet usages charges are higher rates for non pack . It should be there for less usages, however if usages are higher, would recomend some special rates or discounted rates .
 Agents at Payment Desk didn't accept Card Payment and for Cash payment they directed to kriosk machine . Don't know what they are sitting for . Apart frombilling issues, I also requested for a plan change with 3G but still not activated and got no updates regarding the same . Kindly address to customer's queries seriously and improve the Quality of Service .
 Excellent and provide gud sevice
 Always good response in the stores .
 she lisened to my comlain carefully
 Overall very good experience with Vodafone executives
 While in long Q of payment credit card m/c was not working & was not ready to accept cash . 2ndly I asked for stppping Bollywood SMS for which I hv to pay 5 Rs everyday, just after removing that I again recd same SMS of Bollywood subscription, while I asked to reversal of charges was ignored . Forthly Iam repeatedly asked to improve reception signal strength at my home .
 Conduct of your associate who attended me was quite good but the conduct of Mr Ashish acting store incharge in absence of regular store incharge was unpleasant and undesirable
 Felt very well speaking to your store associate . it was good experience keep it up!! !
 Too many formalities to disconnect a connection
 My sms tariff was not deactivated
 In the 2nd last visit to yur store...i went to convert my connection from postpaid to prepaid...then there was somewht problem in my billing address even then i had been told to give the request of address change,nd so i had submitted my all self signatured documemts to yur store at that day ...then i had been told it will be took near abt 4 days to complty change d address , when i reached again to yur store after 4 days then manger nd other employs were saying there iz no request avilable on there dekstop.. .
 If you want to know the detail then phone me .
 Thnk u
 Well I was promised that I ll have the service activated by end of the day it's the next day and it's yet to get active so I am still wondering why andI am OK to wait because it's not important for me but when it's really important then pls do what is promised or take extra time but Don't make ur customer come and scream and argue
 My credit card has been debited without the recharge being done . You really rip off customers . A very bad experience when the recharge was urgently needed
 Very bad services from Vodafone
 Quick turnaround time after queueing up on the token machine..helpful personnel named Bhushan, who suggested a change in plan that suited my usage more
 I am happy to visit at store.slogan HAPPY TO HELP Match with ms PRIYANKA Suparb.. .
 I was attended to immediately and my query was resolved promptly .
 Was attended to very respectfully and my job was done quickly.. .
 Executive's are very helpful this time
 There was no place to sit, kindly provide chairs etc there . Secondly more help counters are needed not adequate for large amounts of people .
 Unhappy to help you
 Having been your customer for 15 years was denied a change of sim . Sim was on company name . I was carrying an I'd from a competent authority stating I was a partner in the company but was denied . I just wanted to change my old sim to a new micro sim . No change in any plans or ownership or payment instruction . But the person wanted an noc on co letter head . I m not wanting a new sim or changing any plans/instructions . Also had required I'd proofs viz election card driving license .
 I am very happy to vesit to vodfone store & sandhya a kulkarni info technic is verry nice iam verry verry happy to visit 10 marks
 Excellent
 Your executive solve my prob and very frndly nature thx to vodafone
 Kept us waiting needlessly as the first operator was doing some house keeping work
 Store executive is very polite and very friendly i would request vodafone pls appoint executive like harkaran
 Not ready to help asking me to mail at Vodafone I ask him you can mail on my behalf about the problem I am facing regarding internet charges in my bill
 Without my concerned 1599 data pack activated but no one helped
 pl take it + 4 ur employees but there is urgent need 4 cust / employees ratio correction in voda offices . The most unorganised office of baba thansingh chowk where u hav 2 wait like beggars . I had even *** arguments with one of ur employee may be pressure of work . This time i really admire the employeesitting over there . Even mall road needs attemtion . but . big ? on ur unmanaged skills . Again requesting not to harrass ur people but satisfy customers .
 First at your store there were less agent to attend the customer .It took 1hr to attend me .
 Al the member of voda fone family were very coprative and active
 He was extremely helpful in words and deeds
 1. The paper bill has not been delivered at the mailing address since last 2 months . 2. The payment has been done at Vodafone Mini Store well before duedate but payment has not been realized at your end in proper time . Payment has been realised after the due date as per the SMS received by me, but why shI visit it, even for collecting a bill if one has to wait for 40 minutes, that is not acceptable .
 Very Good
 The executives in the store don't have intention to resolve customer quarries . I am really disappointed with the customer service . Therefore I have decided to close my postpaid plan on 15th of dec . I believe I can relay on service providers for better service .
 Staff at Dalhousie are more professional than at Tollygunge, they get distracted at anything that are thrown at them suddenly by their colleagues who r not capable at their own .
 Even after waiting for 1 hour , they could not solve problems..additionally executive was not polite
 vodafone agent Ekansh was very polite nd helpful..glad to visit the store
 Good service
 I did not end my conversation with your associate, he already started calling the next customer to attend . What does this mean ?
 Your plans are missleading and not customer oriented
 Not bad
 Ur staffs not sincerity and wrong informations any time
 10-Overall service from executive was good

 orget nano sim
 I like the way the executive mohammed azharuddin has helped me to resolve my issue with coplete info thanks for azhar
 Listen customer & Speak polite .
 It's far better than earlier responses . Some more training on promptness is required .
 with another famous song was disinterested to help me so at the end I fail to know why he was acting like that way.plz let me know if possible .
 It was good to meet exec deepak in the store he helped a lot to solve my query with politness .
 The staff was less..otherwise good service
 you are solve my problem within 4 hours . otherwise i am take legal action
 I'm happy with the quick response and resolution best service .
 Terrible signal at my billing address and residence- no one has any real solution to the problem . Secondly I get the "download app" message 3 times a day .
 1. Vadafone activated a service itself without my request or consent . 2. Even vadafone service centre is not able to explain what i can do with service activated on vadafone, then how can i know to use it . 3. Vadafone is making crores of fraud by activating unnecessary paid services not desired by post paid customers 4. I will complain about this fraud in TRAI and CONSUMER FORM. 5. I will write to telecom ministry and PMO about thia vadafone fraud .
 Very cool store,and mr.prince the one man army of store.really great person
 Your staff was polite and gave respect to everyone . I was apprehending lot of time but it didn't take my much time . I hope service will continue
 I think during interaction your associates are polite,listen carefully and give the solution for the problem what we have .
 Very with your service
 I am satisfied .
 Very satisfied with service

 It was a nice experience there
 Very bad, customer service

 Pleasing people ready to help cooperative polite
 Realy nice service
 Delayed service, untrained resources , insensitive towards customer issues & incorrect commitment towards TAT: really very unprofessional
 essionally .
 Overall vodafone provide good service .
 Best way for me and my friends
 Not at satisfactory 1 out of 10
 Prompt and efficient service
 Overall it was good
 Gagandeep was the person who attended me, he was least interested to solve my query .
 The store functioning was excellent . But please make the process a little fast as it takes a long time Sometimes to attend your representative
 Overall satisfied with vodafone
 I have a query on my last bill which is billed extra . I took a booster pack net data on 30th oct and not used beyond the data which i got..and the bill has some kind of service activated which was not required . The store executive took so much of time to understand that from the bill and was trying to explain me with illogical explanation . I was not convinced and the query is still unsolved . 3 different people from customer care and collection have told me 3 different things regarding the same over the phone . I will write an email tomorrow for the same .
 The time between token generated and the time to u finally get attended Is the root problem ....especially when u see that there are 7-8 counters and customers are being att ended on an measly one or two and the balance staff is enjoying... . U may also monitor the vide cameras out there... . Also As per them there is no priority counter intact the one mentioned with a name plate needs to be modified .... . People are being attended on cash payment counters....and service with a smile has gone for a toss.... . If u really want the output of this all women's outlet which has no control mechanism whatsoever ....pls try taking a surprise score from outgoing customers either by personal calling or posting a person to take feedback inside or outside the counter
 The attendants should try to close the cases quickly . Some people prolong it too much and the waiting people suffer .
 Appreciate your sr citizens priority
 It was very good today
 I asked for the lowest plan,they gave me something else . They say if my net is ON and even if i am not using the net i will be charged for using my net,which i find strange . mukhtar
 First of all I had to wait from 12.50pm till 2.30 for my turn.My number was 122 & 107 was on when I got the receipt . Many ppl came after me but got a cha,ce earlier as they wanted to open a new account or they were senior citizens . I just wanted an itemize print out with all details as the one i got yesterday in email didn't have details of my family/friends free number i have taken.the associate i guess didn't believe me and asked me for proof . I asked him to give me access to net where i can download the bill sent to me by email . There no phone or computer present there where i could show him the bill.Then i said i even have the bill on pen drive but even that was not accessible in store . He showed me the itemize bill on his computer which had detailsof the free number but it was n this form 98207**** * which does not show the entire number . I need this itemize bill of free number to prove the visa officer that me nd my wife are in good terms & we talk daily that's why i have kept her number as free number in my Vodafone plan . The associate asked me toemail vcare and said he cant do anything unless i prove it to him that details were not present of free number in itemize bill sent to me . He gave me the print out of from his computer with 98207***** * copies . I need the entire bill summary for last 6 months,can u plz send .
 ays so why my request could not be taken today or coming Sundays ?
 Inflated bills . Unauthorised change of tariff plan .
 Waiting time is more . Store capacity is small but customer are more .
 problen
 I had to visit the Vodafone store 4 times to get a new sim for my new phone . Every Time I went, the associate demanded different things . The staff was certainly not Happy To Help, which is apparently your tag line . I have been a very loyal to Vodafone and personally like the services very much . But afterthis recent incident I might be switching to some other service provider .
 Worst experience with Vida . U charged me more in rental without intimations. . Very poor.. .

 She was very much polite . Gave a good Service
 As we had gone for sim card exchange,the same was executed in the cordial . n efficiently .
 Excellent services . Keep it up .
 I visited there for the re-issue of my sim which my father had personnaly purchased abt 5 yrs back but they said that the sim isn't on ur name and address
 Very happy wid d lady who helped me.appriciation 4 her
 Vodafone network and plan are very good. . So I also suggest my friend to Vodafone connection
 It felt good
 Cooperative staff . Fully aware about all plans . Prompt in service . Very nice store with hardly any waiting time . Satisfied with service .
 Did'nt wait long . Case solved fast
 Took time and 3 visits to activate my no .
 Very satisfied
 o rush today but I had wait more than 20 minute . After all conversation your representative suggesting me instead of solving my issue .
 Actually overall experience was good . But they explain me a plan which I took. . And today when my number got activated. . It does. . That's why.i am goingto give overall 6 rating
 Its Was great, the service given By young girl Was excellent .
 Nobody seems to know the scheme details . I needed free incoming roaming sometime back . None of your store people were able to help . I went to a small corner store and the guy there gave me a one week free roaming recharge within a minute .
 Request for change of plan not yet executed Ref no . 756491139 And 756493887
 whenever I visit Vodafone store, I meet Mr. Anshul there...That young man is quite understanding and helpful .
 Keep it up
 Dear sir we ,as customer require personal attention and point wise solution which we got . Thanks
 Too many formalities, paperwork & procedure . Though the executives wish to help, due to the strict rules they cannot . The tariff & data plan charges tooare overpriced owing to the fact that almost 70% of people requiring internet . Hope U do the needful . Thank You for the awesome service so far .
 The information I expected from the executive is completely not useful . It's like I had wasted my time visiting the store and meeting the executive . If all the information could be obtained from internet then I don't know what is the use of customer care center and executives servicing the customers there .
 Most frustrating people who never have solution as well as interest in giving solution
 Good serviec vodafone
 t of pathetic service you have given to your loyal customer.. . zero empathy of vodafone.. .
 Executive was well knowledge and provided a quick resolution
 Better ask your own people about conversation / interaction unless you do not trust them or they are not considered as assets
 Unsatisfactory assitance with unpleasant behavior
 Nice very good service
 Fast, professional, to the point service at the vodafone store . Much much better than the phone service which is a painful experience .
 Good
 executive was very good at explaining our queries . Happy with the service .
 Fully satisfied. .
 Token system & quick activation of services required .
 Becase Maine ek bar cheq se pyment kiya uske bad bhi mujhse dobara cash payment krwaya gya thatswhy

 I am fully satisfied.. .
 Kindly do the needful as soon as possible
 Not satisfied at all . Badly behaved staff,
 i feel very comfortable while talking in vodafone store. . the executive listen me patiently and respond me well .
 Very understanding people .
 GOOD
 A separate mail is send today to Corp care . Mah@vodafone.com
 I met personnely many time but no body taking interest to resolve my problem & also ur tecnical team is not proper knowledge .
 teep increase in my monthly billing cycle.Due to which there was a complaint generated.my outgoing calls have been barred which had made me dissatisfiedThe reason for my rating is as your sales representative gave info about the information on 3g pack without informing about the 850 capping there was a s
 I got my resolation hand 2 hand.....very nice exp.....over all 10 out of 10
 He was so great to clear all my issues in one time i was really appritiate him
 :-)
 First of all ur store executives are untrained and unprofessional, secondly they are so rude with the customers third and last they are not ready to list
 Sirs, It is really appreciated that Vodafone is so keen for feedback . 2 years ago, my daughter, Shree ,had Vodafone post paid connection 8007278880, Wegot it closed as she was to go USA. Accidentally final bill was paid twice , by her as well as you me . I tried to get the additional payment back , but nso I got two post paid connection, for me & my wife, as I have special feeling for Vodafone for my own reasons , but pathetically, services are very poorat local officials . I am really thankful to Vodafone Management for giving me this opportunity .
 I was charged unnecessarily for downloads which I did not do . I do not have android phone why would I download . Further had it been Rs.20 or Rs . 30 I would not have bothered but it cost me Rs.200 which is almost equal to my monthly rental . The customer care is not understanding and refunding . I have always paid my bill on time and has been a loyal customer for around 20 months now . Even my usage has increased 3 times more in last 4-5 months and I pay in advance . If Vodafone still does not care I will look for Airtel . I never had such complaint with Airtel previously . I look forward for ur cooperation .
 The experience was okay but a few things were unexplainable .
 Fast action . Few years ago I was switched to Vodafone because of best best network and service in Gujarat circle . but now days network is a problem . 3g mostly turns in 2g. Pls improve it . Regards
 Quick service, Store Associate was well informed, Explained to me in detail, to my satisfaction
 The courteous behaviour of the staff . The guidance given by staff was quiet helpful .
 Medium speed of service, although the process of adding 3G packs and top up of pre-paid contracts was simple and quick . Good staff .
 Overall a good experience . Quite organised at the store . Was attended to immediately as soon as I walked in .
 store for FAQ/problems or give quick printouts for problem oriented solutions
 Vodafone service so good
 There r only 2 counter is working & otherone where Mr akhhey was sitting . Lot of person was sitting it was app 1.45 afternoon time . I was there for new sim . I was out of showroom app 2.30 pm but app 6.00pm I have to go there bcz they have not done work . I was worried that on Sunday that showroom will b closed .
 Overall exp good . Service dispenser was out of paper roll .
 Exclent service by executive good way of talking
 50/100
 I was very much irritated to send feed back 4 times .
 The employees were gossiping on the vacant table with no one to attend therefore I had to wait for 15 mins . First a guy took me to an employee without the ticket where she seemed rather playing Candy Crush instead of addressing my issue . Then he asked me to take a ticket and wait . The guy who attends me was clueless and chit chatting with other employees . He was asking irrelevant questions . He then got another employee and started arguing with her . After20 minutes he asks me about the plan . The employee had entered a wrong plan than what he had told me hence billing me 1200 where the usage was of Rs 0. He then starts explaining what plan he had entered incorrectly which was of no concern to me . After all this waste of time and irrelevant talk he asks meto visit after 3 days and "check". Also teach your ground staff general mannerisms and etiquettes to talk .
 It was very satisfactory, friendly and helpful .
 No response, no issue resolution , no ownership inspite of my personal store visits 3 times and phone calls to customer service
 Patience of the person who serviced is extraordinary
 We got immidite respons by exicutive but a bit unhappy in statisfaction
 All queries regarding safe custody of number was promptly resolved
 I am not satisfied with your service since from last two years. . My uses r very less but my billing is very high every time when I visit your store I feel that I vest my time and money
 Where are you ? Can we talk ?
 my problems not sorted inspite of assurance of 24 hrs
 Very rude
 I convinced store people, but they don't have a convincing power to convince billing department .
 Provides Information mismatch
 Had a proibkem with blackberr internet He gave me a number to dial in case the problem persisted for 24 hrs which worked Store AC was not working
 Very bad
 I require a solution then and there as days waiting is not good for a connection..you say no paper but you are still doing paperwork
 Poor experience takes lots off time very poor customer service
 Net balannce nahi aaya
 Any time store visit given answer very satisfied
 Satisfactory service !
 Compare to earlier 3 visits, this i got result this time

 Super services & happy to visit store
 In order to migrate from prepaid connection to postpaid, no verification was done as also we have informed the executive not to process our application fdata card for rs255 for one month . Nobody at hari nagar Vodafone store helped me, they were just saying that it's not there problem you have to use thior postpaid connection, still postpaid connection activated . The executive who visit our residence he told I will not process it and we had recharge ours postpaid services for one month . I am very disappointed with your poor services at all time . Once my first bill will going to port my connection to airtel .
 MY RENTAL PLAN HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED YET THE MAIN REASON FOR WHICH I VISITED YOUR CENTRE
 The cost of the plans are exhorbitant . It seems VF is misusing the opportunity it has by closure of other cos
 Service is best from Vodafone
 The gentlemen is very soft spoken
 Costumer service given by your store is excellent which satisfy me is the reason .
 Superb service
 Explanations was good
 Well as i said, the store had quite atmosphere, there were not many waiting, and Divya understood my problem and solved it immediately . In past for various reasons I had been visiting the south ex store which is useless . The reason for my satisfaction were 1. Parking was there, 2. Not much waiting 3. Myproblem was solved . Feel free to call me for other feedback .
 Not ready to listen and understand .
 I was satisfied as the lady Savitri at the desk helped me get all formalities done very smoothly.however I was a little dissatisfied with the guy who gotme the token slip .
 Token is not rotated to empty desk . Waiting time was more
 Some of your employees misbehave with customers,a complaint is still in process
 Very nice talking to coustomer representative . He explained and helped very nicely .
 Cooperation was very satisfied
 Don't have spare time for all this
 Customers are more than the employees at your store that's why customers have to wait
 Totally fine
 Service is not given when we visit the store . Different date is allotted . Only to say so much people are made to wait .
 Interaction with Store associate was too good but service is too bad I haven't expected from your end (VODAFONE) .
 Service is good . . And staff behavior is also nice . .
 Store associate's help and his work were the best but he had not explain about work which he had done.hence I have given rate-9 for his work.Overall rating above satisfactory .
 Outgoing calls
 inience of customer . This is nt a complain . Thnx
 As a trust worthy customer packages offered are not satisfied .
 You people lied me did thing what i never asked if there is anyone whom i can speak with that would be apreciated ..... .

 From day one I had visited your gallery -at Churchgate I found your staff helpful most of them-especially Rohit & Rahimi-in fact I brought 2 of my ******* Clients/Guests to your Gallery lately to get Sims
 Very gud.. . Keep it up.. .
 Actually the process is really very slow
 Well to be honest they should have guided everyone as I didn't knew regarding taking a token and then asking me if I had taken a token I was given a handwritten token and there was no space to accommodate people waiting and the AC was off . The executives were choosing on their own as my number was next for a sim change they were keeping me back and sending someone else for some other issues . How can anyone's issue be judged as per their convenience . Theleast they could have done to speed up the process by making our forms filled etc . but when my turn came the whole thing was done without any hassle bythe executive and that saved a lot of time in the end . People management should be done tactfully and should be handled with a smile .
 It was fine and +ve . On counters there are 2 to 3 attendant instead of there should be one mote counter to.be open for customers .
 Different nos . Have differerent talktime chgs why so
 Got what i wanted to know without feeling as if i was wasting their time
 The guy was very polite and humble as he easily accepted a mistake being done by him unlike other executives and he easily gets to the point instead of beating about the bush .
 Very good service and print response
 gud afternoon, i had to visit again and again for the same purpose, they deny to customer care approval or decision, it means there is no need of customer care, the do not work according to customer's desire .
 service provided to the satisfaction
 I liked this postpaid plan . But I've some very personel reason to opt out from it
 Huge waiting time.. .
 What I was looking for I dint get there...I had to contact vfn care...when I walked into your store y cant get satisfactory service when I am using thisnumber from last 3 years .
 I was looking for Sim replacement and the executive was not providing the positive response . Only he was looking for charges for Sim replacement . As perresponse he asked me to submit sim and new Sim will be activated after 2 hrs as per your process . I requested I can not switched off phone for 2 hours.Then he forced me to pay sim replacement charges . Also he put comment in system as a Sim lost, I did not accepted as it was not lost and informed himis as already took token and attended by executive ? Why same executive not completing the entire process ? instead of wasting customer time .
 0 my problem not solved
 Service offered is not flexible enough to please the customer
 Your customer care agents have either not been given discretion to understand the issue and resolve it or they r unwilling to do that .
 Store service is 100% satisfactory 3G coverage is average in shastamangalam area or no coverage
 I have visited Bellandur store n i Want to migrated sim postpaid to pripaid but person who setting the desk he said directly not possibale now u have tocome on billing date but my billig date is 5th is this the way to customer resonse in store ? Bad exprinc with vodafone
 on friday i activated inernet plan for Rs 147 it was not activated so i visited vodafone store on saturday there he told it can be reversed as currency if i agree . i agreed then he asked me to visit the place where i recharged and asked that person to reverse .. . then i visited that place and asked him ttinued
 My rating is for poor and bureaucratic process, which requires me to visit your store again . I haven't considered your poor network coverage in this rating . Your signals are never there at my home .
 My issue remains same.. .
 Behaviour of your employee was very rude .I had submitted all documents to change my ownership.They had given me a new simcard and told that after 72 hrsit will be activated.But after 8 days when I reached in store.They told me that we will see tomorrow.what a joke it is ?
