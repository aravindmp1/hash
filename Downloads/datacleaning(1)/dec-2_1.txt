 Very nice overall experience
 Prior to your store i visited airtel for the same service but i was not attended properly rather ignored . On contrary i was mesmerised with ur service .

 For post paid connection they are not showing tariff details & even after reporting problem is not getting rectified
 GOOD

 very excellent work done. . and very fast service to the customers. . full satisfied with the services provided on the store
 No interest shown by staff to help at the Vodafone store in goa. . Was happier getting a SIM card from an outside vendor than from the Vodafone store . Hadto wait for my query to replce a sim to nano even after it was my turn as staff were busy with their own work
 Awesome ..-:)
 Irresponsible attitude . Visited more than six times to your store but my complaint is still not resolved . R.K.Aurora
 Store representatives need to guide customers properly
 Overall grt experience
 Even after a long wait Internet connection not available . No proper reply for questions Asked .
 Good service good solutions gentle staff experiencing from last 7 years
 ded by store executives was excellent !
 I got very good service
 Kindly arrange the call back from retention department... .

 Totally not like to your service
 I got good service and my problem was solved appropriately in a hassel free manner
 Worst service ever .
 For no reason my connectivity failed from 30th morning while I called up 140 I was told I should get my replacement sim but was nort informed about carrying original id proof.after getting replacement sim still I had no connectivity . I kept trying & the call center asked me to get my phone check ed but all of a sudden the connectivity came back on 31st even ing
 I was satisfied the way the store associate helped me with my queries . He was quick to give me a resolution .
 I got excellent service
 I had a very good experience with that specific store in which i had visited . Everytime they helped me whatever i need . Thanks
 I went to the store in order to change my existing plan to a cost effective one under e_connect category . The manager simply refused without any furtherdiscussion . Im planning to migrate all my 3 voda numbers to another provider by next week .
 ond thought
 I am fairly satisfied by your service .
 My query was answered hence the reason 4 this rating
 Very good
 Experience vt your store executive was v.good,but had to wait for more than one hour in waiting for the turn was not appreciable
 Hidden charges, no complete service for the tarrif
 Associates are helpful and of postive attitude . But the entire process is quite long and cumbursome
 So much kiosk in the store still agent helped me with clamness nd resolved ma all query....nd helped mecwith best plans
 not change my required plan .
 Seating arrangement is not enough given waiting time Announcement of waiting number by associate has to be automated mobile phones on display are password makes it difficult for customers to view features
 The explanation which was given by your staff was helpful to understand the details about what are tariff and other details
 Very cooperative
 Improper communication,lethargic and not caring about customers
 Mujhe 40 mnt wait krna pda waha pr waiting me kafi dikkaten aye waha sirf 4 counter hi chal rhe the jis wajah se waiting krni pdi
 I don't reply the same thing again and again
 - nice. .
 Way of communication is too good to solve my problem . And plans r also good but data plan is to coastly, it should be cheaper
 My outgoing was blocked on 30 dec 14 due to pending bill.even after clearing the bill the and talking to the people in your store as well as over the 24hours helpline for 3 times all together was of no help . Till now the outgoing is blocked .
 She explained all my queries and took necessary action which may help me to pay my contract bill in time . Hope I will get updated bill amount by tomorrow
 Waiting time was very high . ...People doesn't look professional . ...they don't know how to behave work customers
 there are too many unwanted calls from unknown people .
 I VISIT ON VODAPHONE GOOD FEELING THEIR.GOOD BEHAVE VODAPHONE STAF'S.
 Only network problem is thete
 Firstly, the Vodafone red concept is too cute . Vodafone store is catchy visually . Good to have 24/7 service .
 ive to another store and obtained it for us .
 Thanks for your all help .
 They could not accept or promise to solve the excess billing problem.But just said that higher officers have to solve and will take time and they will message the officer concerned
 Satisfied with welcome n co-opertion of voda store. .
 Pleasure, and very immediate responce. .
 004900200064006900640020006E006F00740020006C0069006B006500200061006E006400200066006F0075006E00640020004900200077006100730020006E006F007400200074007200650061007400650064002000770065006C006C002E004900200066006F0075006E00640020007400680065006D00200068006100720073006800200061006E006400200072007500640065002E
 Gud service
 Your store manager openly told that "we can't give service every where" including capital city . You people just brief him about mobile and it's benefits.complaint . The onle thing whic works properly is the billing cycle and billing date . I'm not going to stop it here, we got some rule called consumer court (Grahak jago) where we I can get justice .
 Very good staff very coopreting
 Mera net ka bill bahot jyada aaya hai to plz mera bill me discount dijiye extra advertising jo net pe aati hai vo bhi bandh kardo.otherwise me protability karva lunga thank you
 Very exlent survice
 The overall experince was good but there was not enough sitting space there for senior citizens.I was satisfied with your staff . The lady who attended us was also satisfied as she fulfil all my querry positively .
 There were 6 counter but only 3 were working . I have to wait for nearly 1 hr to get my new SIM card which is just 5 min work . The team was not at all supportive . There shld be seperate counter for lost SIM card which take only 5 min work .
 I was told everything in a hurry and bacause of that i was not able to hear clearly what they were saying
 Whatever I need, I got within time limit .
 Please provide a proper training to the staff and have it more organised as it was a mess and people were everywhere when I walked in . No designated areafor waiting .
 Ratings selected are self explanatory
 er was present at the desk attending to customers despite other staff talking to each other . But the query was dealt with quite well
 She is very nice n talking politely n solution my problems
 Good
 The staff a lady was not keen on sorting out my issues . Normally this store is good with it's service but bad staffs make bad name .
 nice envorment
 Store is nice and the staff is too polite and helpful in explaining the plan that suit as per my requirement
 It's worst
 The person over could not help me
 It was really good experience visiting the store . The attendee responded promptly . Good work .
 I m hapiee 2 use Vodafone
 As usual no solution for the problem . I wasted my time visiting store. . And what ever promised also did not happen. .
 I was welcome nicely . Evry employee help me in each step. So they deserve the rating .
 The executives are well trained...but the gallery remains open only till 7 pm, which is inconvenient for office goers.. .
 Improve your serviced....manishverma772@gmail.com
 Venrful job ajay gondaliya ajay is great Ajay is supar se upar supar job is vodafone
 When I visited store he was guiding a customer for the documentation of ownership change . The documentation process was too long . The customer was screaming upon him . I think this type of ownership change process should happen from their Relationship manager's end . The executive's patient was very much appreciable .
 Mr Kunal with whom I interacted is very smart ! I recommend him promotion . He can be an asset to Vodafone !
 I am using 599 per month plan . This month i get Rs . 980 bill and ask customer care is there any beter than this plan . He said no .
 Very good service
 Very good experience.. .
 His response was quick and up to the mark . Vodafone guys should have same knowledge regarding everything .
 Happy New Year.. . I am so happy with your service. .
 My issue was taken care of immediately by the executive .
 Staff was courteous and explained properly .
 Good experience.. .
 Coz They Had A Nyc Way To Talk Vd Me, Nd They Had Every Solutions For My Problm, Nyc Dressing Sens Nd They Told Me Each Detail Of All Kind Of Recharge Plan, Nd They Told Me Which Recharge Plan Is Helpful For Me All Over Its A Too Gud Expierence For Me Thnks
 s only (Busy in their personal life) . Also show the attitude to the customer . Few of them were lazy not the all . So it was bad experience for me.Thank u.Ur service is good . Bt ur few store associate did not respond properly . Even there were lots of costumers in the queue nd they were talking on phone call
 All workers are really good .. .
 I am satisfied with ur service .
 Good

 I fully satisfied with your facilities of your store... .
 Don't wish to comment
 Excellent
 Nowadays Vodafone's coverage is getting poorer . Earlier I used to catch 3 different towers of Vodafone's in my house . Nowadays I can't catch one tower clearly
 Able to extend the required service at the earliest possible time . Also the staff were able to communicate the requirements precisely . Thanks for immediate migration to a new phone within an hour .

 For Q1: Vodafone deserves the caption " Happy to help" so I gave rating as 9/10
 Its OL
 Simply super
 Yesterday it was excellent service...i am impressed
 Good service
 Overall the staff is well trained,service is good,but there is lack of coordination between various departments
 Very helpful and understanding nature for sr.citizen
 Satisfied with your service
 The place is very stuffy and the staff is good but had to wait a lot to get my work done .
 It was not crowed when I went in.....quick n responsive service ..
 Superb n fast service
 Every customer is very imporatant for you so take care for saving time of customer .
 Little bit Satisfied
 Is very good Identity
 The executive told 2 hrs the new sim will work, it took 14 hrs and just for xerox of pan card and sim, they took 20min . It a long time on hold . I m 12 yrs old
 Pl refer to mail which i addressed to nodal officer ur cse is pathetic
 Delay in attending customer nearly half an hour
 Very good
 Customer care executives are not at all taking care of given requests and giving false promises / commitments .  A CUG code wrongly updated has not been corrected after giving requests atleast 10 times in 1 and a half years .  There are many as such yet to be listed .
 Team doesnt know the process, spoke very harsh
 Really good
 Your store associate not handled my query properly, like i asked them to provide me the updated corporate plan of IBM DAKSH. But they said we do not havethis information .
 Had to wait for one hour and then found out since I was from a different circle they could not take my request
 2G net speed & servise is poor
 Satisfied with the services .
 Trained pepople r not employed . Lack of Ipr .
 Executive told that new sim charge 25.they took fifty rs along with sim charges nd talk time . nt gvn specification.I received only 16 rs talk time .
 Till date free 500 Mb 3g internet is not activated . This was available for 2 Months
 Instant effort to solve issues is appreciated .
 we visit vodafone store to get final solution . i was asked to contact nodal officer. they should have power to take immediate decision .
 Truely good experience .. . what ever queries I have they have answered very well .

 The customer care executive was helpful
 Store Associate are good but service is not up to mark

 Service was fast but I didn't get what I want . I visited Vodafone store to replace my sim and get a nano sim . Sim was not available and time given was I 1 week .
 Solved my query very easily and quickly .
 Wrong Billing
 Pathetic service and pathetic network
 Exec was very helpful....and resolved my querry in one go
 Nice service
 I feel to happy
 Staff were trend as they know what customer needs and staff were listning paitantly to senior citizens as i observed while waiting in gallary till my turn came . One supervisor attending all the staff they need it with smile on his face . All though it took time but expierance was great .
 Executive very patience and clearly explain

 Had very good experiance .was attended by priyanka n she hlpd me beyond my problem very excellent service
 Employees had given answers politely and my all the problems solved at same place.. . Its great.. . Thank you vodafone !
 My complaint no 1640830708 and my balance deduction of Rs 30 on 28 dec is not be sortout .
 I had been to Vodafone store on 30/12/2014 evening , after 40- 45 minutes the token number 182 flashed on counter D , but the person was totally blank and said that next number button pressed by person sitting at counter F , you go there & solve the problem . At least the person sitting at should know the which is flashed on T V.
 The attendants were usually busy in their personal matter which made us wait a lot .
 At the store executives don't look at the person at the counter who is first and who is next they deal only the single person and not entertain other towait after that the deal with randomly.. . I waste more than 1 hour for a new prepaid connection
 The executive took too long complete the formalities . It was just the change of ownership but still took so long . It was quite frustrating .
 Its gud to folow procedure to serve customes but at the same time procedure must be customer friendly .
 50rs charge apply for care that's ... !
 Please call me i am not satisfid
 Interaction is nt again parfful is nt good with communication is nt
 Yes i am not happy .
 Past 3 months my outging calls not working . I m unable to make calls . Despite vising vashi gallery . So i hav requestd for new sim with same number .
 I had asked to deactivate my 3g services months back and have been charged for it . Now that I want to convert my connection to pre-paid, Sonia from Vodafone Store is telling me I have to pay despite of them not taking any action . Have all requests on mail .
 Easy processing, and the advisor had good knowledge of all the plans and was courteous too.. . I did not have to wait long too .
 Excellent Vodafonr store with . Good Service
 Why does Vodafone require a whole agreement set for address change ? And if this is required by DOT, TRAI or some government regulation, why is this information not displayed on the Vodafone web-site ?
 The connection is still not been activated very bad and pathetic
 The executive had 0 knowledge about the bill..he had to ask someone else..and when i told him what was promised to me when i changed to billing he told me i need to talk to the same guy which was not possible..does that mean all advisors give different promises to the customers?i will never promote vodafone
 Please -please-please do needful to solve my problems . HAPPY NEW YEAR MY FRIENDS
 ivated . The store has promised me that the SIM will be functioning in 2 hours, but it was not working even after 48 hours . In the store, the waiting tiing which is not expected from Vodafone .

 I gave the above ratings with the hope that my request for proper unlimited 3 G Connection will be fulfilled . For the last few months I am suffering without 3G. Kindly do the needful . Thank you .
 Please check my requests on your system n understand because of your adamant stupid rules i took airtel no n m using it
 I think even when the payment is done late there is interruption in the network and i find that worth appreciating .
 Its good
 My only comment is that I have used your Lajpat Nagar outlet a few times and have always had a good experience with the staff who are very helpful .
 They didn,t have sim cards and asked me to go to park street Vodafone store . What's the point in opening a store at alipore then ?.
 Service experience...8  Interacttion...with person....mr.umesh...10
 I didn't get the proper solution on my first visit . I had to spare my precious time all over again . :s
 There was big que in sion and no good management also but the representative was very good
 Liars
 We were kept waiting . There were 3 counters but at two counters there was no customer care people . There were no chairs to sit but we were kept standingand waiting . Coupon no . Which was appearing on the tv was placed at inappropriate wall .
 Staff at Vodafone store in sinhgad is co-operative and there service is up to the mark
 I dont get good response.amd dident get _i`t good no . For my new conection of prepard card . No body have any answer .
 They take too much time to solve customers query which results to long waiting in the store and too much crowd Also not all employees are knowledgable about the problems I was there in the store for more than 1 hour which was very tiring
 On my second visit to the store, where I simply had to provide my documents for updating my address, I had to wait for 2 hours . Waiting that long is veryirritating, especially when your number is shut down at short notice . This can be resolved by having a separate desk purely for submission of documentsand similar formalities . Further my address is still not updated in the records as confirmed by the call center . So Pv check might fail again .
 8 KaKa:-)
 odafone main office in Nashik is very ruthless. .
 I have many problems when I use Internet in Vodafone my balance deducted many times .

 Worst experience with ur vodafone store park street . Ur executive are very busy in over phone even the won't respond well because of there own work . Am very very unhappy with ur services .

 Vodafone is a very good company but the store associate is not good they detected my 25 rupees for giving me a duplicate sim and doesnot give me my previous balance .
 the attendant was very sweet and helpful !
 dafone charging extra is not my headache,u need to solve it .
 Exelent service,
 Your service providers are very helpful and tries to give best efforts in their service .
 The store is Clean and well maintained . the staff is courteous . the security person opened the door when i entered and when i left he wished me a happy new year . Overall a pleasant experience .
 Drastic Experience , Please convert my existing number to my Company CUG as already I have submitted my documents to your vodafone store at Bhilai twentydays prior,so kindly do the needfull as soon as possible
 7829355634-outgoing &incoming very slow
 The service is very slow a faster service will be highly apreciated
 My request raised 4 months ago is still not serviced . Need better customer orientation and professionalism .
 Though my work wasn't sucessful, I received good advises and very friendly behaviour .
 Good
 Please improve your services u r not more then a mtnl store
 Vodafona in best services
 I wanted to change my sim to nano . I was told there is no stock . I was ****** off when i got the respnse as i was in the main vodfne store . He also informed none of the stores in blore has stock .
 The service was quick and prompt resolution was provided but the representatives should learn to be more courteous
 Great experience
 I have visited store at nanded for sim replacement the person in front of me has raise free sim replacement sr and had taken rs.120.00 from me against charges
 Ur staff Mr.Kajamoideen rended a very good servise.He deserve all appriciation.Thanks to VODOPHONE.
 vodafone charged me . I am going to quit this connection and whatever happens I wont pay this bill . This is cheating .
 Very cooperative, friendly atmosphere, eagerness to resolve the issues, dedication n commitment towards their responsibilities .
 My simple request for address change could not be completed though I gave documents 2 times . Still not completed yet .
 Tedious process to cancel and misinformation at POS
 Service experience was good along with the interaction, i was just confused about the token number on screen, that was useless and should be improved,
 After visiting 2 of the vodafone stores, I still could get my SIM replaced . One of the store saying they are out of stock and other saying out of 'connectivity', didn't sound reasonable enough to me . On top of that, saying it might take 2-3 days for the same shows the preparedness you have . It was reallydisappointing for me . I hope you will take the feedback positively and work upon it .

 By mistake gave 1.
 Reason 1.when I reached at your office mr.aman attended me he taken so much time yo resolve problem . Reason 2.after 3 days when connection started of Vodafone the sim not worked for 2 days after that they charged 25rs . For replacing sim it is wrong because that was not my fault that was your sim is defected . Thanks rohit chhabra
 The equipments kept at the store like 3 G stick, & USB DEMO were not working . So why they are not repaired ?
 I can come later if you wish . Trust everything is OK.
 U r store associates are very good and capable to solve the visiters problem but they have lot of work load . They need some supportg man power . But callcenter and the associates who start the new connetn . Is not so much interested in custermer requirment plan .
 Clean pleasing office helpful staff
 Sim replesment
 I m happy
 Cassual attitude and not botharing about time of costemer by staff even not mantaining QU are some of the embrassing moment at store
 Most custemer use in Vodafone 2g.3g network cus care service good fully statisfied
 Behaviour
 Good service
 I am not able to receive my bill physically at my home
 I had a bad time just to have a new connection and a nano sim.Of all the staff only two had courtesy towards the customers and rest had no value of timeof customers.Its not good to give incomplete information to people,
 The executive was very helpfull

 In a given day ; we have to wait.more than 1;50 hr to get to talk to executive.some needs to monitor which counter is taking more time and do the needful .

 Good coverage
 Excelent
 l customer friendly or helpful
 While the problem faced was peculiar and the store associates had also not ever faced earlier , they were able to resolve it and resume me services within 24 hrs
 Prepaid queries are addressed more quickly than post paid in gallrery.have to wait for long time for my queries to be addressed .
 This is the best
 No consumer satisfaction
 Sure
 Process and plans are complicated . Need to be simpler to activate
 not good.. .
 Jo plan btate ** vo milta kio ni hai or sim prepaid krne k lia 3 bill ka jruri hai kia
 I had to wait for 30 minutes as no body was available . I even thought of terminating my relationship with Vodafone .
 Varinder singh provide gud info about number or company
 The executive could have a little more generous tonne of talking
 Wao
 I am satisfied about your quick response and service
 Over all i had good experience with staff and with Vodafone store thats why i have given the ratings .
 Vodafone store's staff are not to gud n all work are very dealy n lazzy staff's
 I don't get details of more tarrif plans and also not received proper response for change in address .
 Behaviour of your store associate was rude, it seems that he wasn't know about the soft skills or how to treat customer
 good helpful behaiour esp by DHANAJAY
 I am completely satisfied with the employee
 Over all is very good and i have seen is vodafone center as compere other service center
 Please start 3G network in my area..thanks
 Vodafone service are very helpful .and the experience is nice .. .
 Ratings are depending upon the service provided by Vodafone . Continue the same
 Good 10/10
 The behaviour of the store on M.G.Road ,JMD towers,Gurgaon was pathetic.They were non cooperative and rude as if they were doing a favour.Particularly Vinay.But your staff at Mini store in Vyapar Kendra,Gurgaon was very cooperative and considerate . They were excellent.Hope your staff on M.G.Road, Gurgaonimproves otherwise you might start losing your customers .
 ll put me back in d same plan . I shud wait and see .
 Call centre n service associate in contradiction .
 Best customer satisfied .
 Yes i m satisfied vodafone services
 I was attended properly and my requests were immediately addressed . I am fully satisfied with the services .
 Warmth nd smart answers
 My appreciate vodafone employees good job is rating no.10 thanx
 First of all your executive didn't even ask me to sit in customers chair when I approached her . I took the chair by myself . Secondly no smiley welcome fry new mobile Lumia 730. But now I got msg as the free data will be given to first time internet users and as i am having data pack in my number iam notom anyone . Third, Vodafone is not up to the words what they said.I was informed I will get 1gb data free for first two months when I insert Vodafone in meligible to get free data 1Gb . this is really taking me to a new height of ffrustration.for ur kind information here in kumbakonam we cant get new vodafone sim card without data pack.then how is it possible.I feal like iam cheated by vodafone . This is not a good move by a very international brand . Any have only datisfaction is your network really appreciate for the excellent coverage,still the signal drops wen i use 3g, still better than other networks 3g.only signal drops never break completely . Hats iff to your network strength . Ok now am sending this msg trusting ur words as this msg is free . The blow
 Am upset basically with ur centralised customer care dept... . no one seems responsible . ..even after having booked for portability to another service provider ur team has not bothered to call back pat 3mths . Pathetic state..had to go to a store to do the needful
 nce . I was free to opt my tariff plan . But I don't understand why they withdrew the Smart Phone Premium 500 plan .
 Got all questions answered in a detailed n cordial manner .
 The executive was so friendly, educated me on the various offers and guided me accordingly
 Very easy and good service interaction with your representative . Clear cut process in place, so no confusion . Quick resolution . Good attitude of staff .
 Extremely long waiting time, vodafone store not equiped to transfer data . Store personals more interested to push postpaid connections than solving matters.. . Park st store has not guided anything about new sim.. . Overall.. . Extremely unprofessional
 As I visit the store first time after mnp no one guide me for token I was unattentive at malad wn I went for token the guy was on floor at the token sidewas takng new connection said kya karna hai token I said I hve a issue with network since 15 days so wo problem hai then I said I hve a issue wd net also was nt wrkng properly inspite of I hve activtd 399 10 days ago n balance getting deducted frm my main balance,there was zero solution to my quires themobile guru n executive were nt very motivated at all on there job,who will pay my money whch I lost it,if this the service I will tell all my people nottake vodafone as m wrkng for corporate company(n) very bad service
 sphere.. .
 The staff at the store was very careless and was least bothered to hear what I was telling
 My mobile stop working every now and then because of substandard nano SIM card which was changed twice . Your representatives sold me a plan that raised my bill from an average of RS. 1200 to RS. 2000. When enquired they advise me to discontinue services that I am subscribing . It turned out that I am not sdiscourteous and hopelessly ill trained . Please help me to migrate back to Airtel . Jagdish Arora
 Till now good experience
 Very nice experiance but near piller no.68 dmrc road bihind city court sikendarpur gorgaon your network is very weak . Please do somthing in this regard .
 I was very happy with the response by the staff regarding my problem . My work was completed in short span of time . Thanks and regards .
 Yours is a big giant co . I expected the same high . But that was not to be . Other co is providing 3G @175. And there also such type of irregularities in user with highest fluctuations in showing the actual user . Not a pleasant experience .
 Fast service
 The time taken to get my turn was long..ie . Queue time was long. . But the service and the experience was excellent and fast processing of requests as well
 port my both numbers to other service provider
 Reception with knowing human value Satisfying customers Need Thank you M.pragatheeswaran Happy new year
 Exelent
 Nice experience
 Scope for improvement is there
 1. I had to wait for about 15 minutes , which was irritating since I had just a query on roaming . 2 the customer service representative answered my question readily and without any reference to any book or consultation with anyone- hence was knowledgable 3 Service with a smile 4 Was willing to advise , which was a good thing . Thanks a lot Vodafone .
 Good service.. .
 Excellent
 He was attentive and helpful .
 Store closes too early.. . U could consider giving Home service also . 1 service free for every 10,000Rs usage . Then chargeable
 **** at the store is very helpful.she is the best
 Satisfied
 Rating goes on decreasing from no1 to no4 I think its because your staff members who were attaining us were overburden with a workload
 Very inconvenience service provided .
 Employee is very corprative
 Gud and exclnt service. . i love vodafone
 I felt comfortable
 Very rude humiliation and use of foul language and insult in public...would like to request for immediate termination of vodafone connection
 Problem solving attitude
 Your senior monitor in store was very helpfull . As I was attended by very new executive and she was unable to solve my issues .your senior executive wasquick in helping me out . Good experience .
 Courteous,pleasant manner of vodophone staff
 Cse provide complete info and resolve my prob in 1st attempt
 Vodafone service is very good service for me. .
 Long ques . Very late attendence on counters . Most of the time on all counters there were only a few executives
 But i got my work done ! Vodofone is the best . I recommend it to everyone as its network is superb .
 Please change the tag line we are happy to help you. . Very bad experience in vodafone . If there is any option of negative marks i wil giv that . U dont deserve 0. Shame on vadafone u r cnt help your coustomers . Check my complaunts
 Excellent Attitude and Service
 Very friendly and understandable talk of vodafone awareness to me .
 Quick response, very helpful gr8
 Im resent send Vodafone store room but I very satisfied
 Thank you
 Good experience
 All Staff are well mannered & helpful but required little more speed & accuracy in getting cleared the dought or quiry of the custormer
 Without our permission action's are taken from Vodafone wrt plan change which is effecting to monthly payments
 Vodaphone staff is knowledgable and quick which is very good . However the courtesy levels can be improved . The staff communicates less and directs customers, while this gets the job done it can be more pleasant . But getting this far with local staff is also a great achievement .
 Executives are good but management is not proper, so customers have to spare a lot of time at the store D A PATEL
 We very much like offers and all type of things . Thank u and u 2 vodafone
 Store facility is very well . & executive behave & responce is very gud
 My ratings are based on my wonderful interaction which i had with the agent at the store .
 Interaction was good and the process was less time consuming
 Too much of bill confusion the associate was not responsible with clear interaction I was lost 2 weeks outgoing call barred its poor for me
 There is room for improvement
 Vodafone stores people do not care abt customer do not know how to speak and absolutely wrong commitment I can name person Shrikant I am NRI and was really shocked to see the service level
 Your staff Vijay at Ady
 I had requested for a micro sim, but it has not been activated yet .
 Im very satisfy .my problems solved in five minits.so thanku very much
 Vodafone is always user friendly and their service centers care for their customers
 Issues with customer care people Co. Appointed candidates who don't have understanding skills regarding issues.Even they unable to transfer call to theirsenior in case of not understanding situation
 ith experienced associate . Overall it is a good experience.Happy New Year 2 all the vodafone family. .
 The staff members at the counter were polite, listening, understanding . But I feel that there should be at least some transperancy while marketing your products and services like explaining your limitations, constraints etc .
 I visited to convert of postpaid to prepaid with all document but they denied to do, becoz of address issue . I show them all the document and at the timeof postpaid sim they will changed the address on phone call . i m not able to visit again and again so cut my connection with immdiate effect .
 Great service
 VeryGood
 my interaction was with the person who was very polite,cordial ,friendly & had proper knw . Of company prod .
 Nice
 No use to comment .
 GoodService
 Improve customer service
 He completely understand our problems and give best solution to it
 It was good experience compare to othr operators .Good thing was it was not a long process to get duplicate sim .
 It was nice exp
 Very good
 The advirors firstly do not understand the problem and the give wrong advise
 Their service good . .
 Pl dont text
 Based on experience I had in the store .
 initially i thought thar it will take about 30-45 mts for the process whereas the whole thing was completd in less than 10 mts .
 your employee done well
 First,booking the ticket makes sure the qeue is followed well.and the customer service agents are well organized and they always happy to help .
 They made me fool and forcebly activated mpesa service and Rs.100 taken from me .
 Problem reported third time but not resolved even aftet a lapse of one month .
 Knowledgable and well trained staff helps quick redressal
 Your people dont stick to their commitments . After entering to your network, demand extra things which is not fair . Pls dont cheat customers . Tks
 The basic reason was that the staff guided me properly . On myearlier visit about a couple of month back forced me to visit mini shop adjecent vodafone
 In service i giving u 8 number bcz porting of my sim is done after 18 to 20 days after drop out porting request in this case me going on store again &again so i m very sad about this service after all in network etc u r perfect
 My balance is jot to refund in my account so . I'll rating 0
 Vodafone always making false commitment
 ed . Provided information is false and no one in store able to give me my correct bill details .
 Good
 When you have so many counters then all should be operational so that customers don't have to wait . For simple transaction of getting a SIM card, I haveto wait at least 15 mins at the cash counter just to give the form and get the sim . For such non critical transactions a separate counter should be assigned
 Nil
 Plz train ur staff so that they have proper sloution of problems rather than beating in the bush .
 stomers . It is uneasy to stand when v r in discussion . Thanq . Manickaraj advocate tirupur
 The ladies are very helpful .

 Quick response & my work on time.thnx to Deepika h 1 more person sorry Im forget his name he was attended me .
 Indpite of repeated requests I still do not get Network at my Residdnce
 Good help me .
 1.The store people are not helpful 2.They don't place name badge 3. They don't want me to cross sign on I'd proof 4. Store manager not attending corporate customers 5. Instead of complaint from they provided some MTP form and humiliated customer .
 People are very friendly and having upto date knowledge about products . Suggesting appropriate schemes
 Full information given by asha mam
 Data champ is unavailable
 Staff was co operative and attended very politely
 There is no feedback on ur store expect seating arrangement
 Very slow rate at which customer requests are handled, even for small requests it takes 45 mins to an hour , realistically which should not take more than10 mins . This was when there were only 3 customers and 3 vodafone execs to help, no rush as such... .
 In one visit your store satisfied my needs urgently
 He charged for sim change even my old sim was faulty, I asked do not charge as my old sim was faulty still he changed for that very disappointment for that
 The vodafone staff is very helpfull
 Assistants are not answering the right answer, they will keep on asking seniors, Training required
 In the vodafone store the customer care officer has no proper information regarding any query... .  They directly tell us we cannot help you....And sorryfor that.. .
 Callous approach .
 All is well . Neat & clean store .
 Purpose nt solved, net pack still nt working
 Superb service
 Wonderful experience . I will recommend to all to visit Vodafone store .
 You people are good at the store but if u a common man get to know all the setting codes for the network it would be ultimate
 Attend the request in good manner with proper solution
 Staff was very respectful and cheerful . However they could not provide the required information . Regards Brigadier Khanna
 Prompt response on time
 Systems are very slow
 Based on working n network factors .
 No one is propmt and honest . . By this issue I haven't get good service. . waste of time and waste of money
 She is very friendly
 The store associate was quite cooperative . My problem was handled in a caring nature .
 Appreciate your service.. .
 Very good service
 I never visited the store personally but the store guy has taken up a request n activated DUPLICATE ITEMISED BILL without my persuasion and now he claimssomeone else visited n gave the request now can a stranger put a request on my number with my consent
 Service is fine . But I expect a better scheme as i could realise it frm other networks .
 Satisfaction
 Really happy with service
 Fast and very customer friendly approach
 I had visited to pay my bill, which I paid in cash . It was not updated for 4 days but the services were terminated due to non payment .
 Reply to all my quiries were satisfying and problem and confusions resolved instantneously
 The Associate who interacted with me was very receptive, helpful, responsive and quck disposal without time lagging
 Services and query resolution was good
 Unruley behaviour and absolute lack of the will to serve
 Good
 Very good
 Veyt
 Server was slow,they are very slow.No experience staff,running with young staff . experience is experience . That you guys should understand . Happy New Year
 Ok
 Its was good
 Satisfied . 7 on rating scale
 Totally irresponsible staff and also not having knowledge about work, and its repeated experience from last 4-5 visits in store
 Vry nice
 Gud service
 All your team has no co ordination root cause is not analyze . We are suffering with your network since beginning . Your RM service is pathetic .
 Good
 There are not have any manners in CCEs... .
 Strictly inform your associates treat customers like guests but now they are treat carelessly especially one person by name Naveen and Raghu at yelahanka store
 Good experience
 I selected plan in @Octobber-'14. Not implemented and explained me on usage it was rejected. . If I select higher rental plan, above reason sounded wrong.Again requested for change in plan . Waiting for positive outcome .
 Your cash counter associate is not supportive to customer.I visited to do bill payment but cash counter is closed and Your Automated kiosk machine is not working for bill payment . Only one thing help your service not to rate 0 that is your store manager's attitude to satisfy the customer . Also I want tosuggest if some one is your customer for long time like me and his limit is 3000 ruppees . Whenever we miss to pay bill on time(which is less than 1000),
 Vodafone is RED.its service is the best
 It is the experience .
 ut that never happens,
 Long waiting time almost 1hr
 There are no argument, store staff hear the problem sort out the problem in right time even xerox also available in store for customer .
 Gud
 I visited...graphit,bangalore store people response is quit bad . They are giving fault information to the customers .
 to other network operators,tz is the 1st time i feel about vodafone service its really happy,feel to proud am a vodafone customer.long way to go .

 Mild songs you can play in the store .
 When I asked for text to discontinue my data pack assistant told that it will automatically get discontinued after change of plan .

 For Q2 to 4 my rating only 5
 VODA FONE staff members is very good custamers receiving,I appreciate in that staff members .
 Good service
 be utilized while attending the customer further minimise time
 it's very free to visit Vodafone store
 Problem/querry, not resolved .
 The supervisor in the store Ajay Roy was extremely disrespectful . I was made to run around for colour copies of ID proof as the photocopy machine in Vodafone store was not working properly .
 Your meanful employees and giving wrong information about postpaid to prepaid plan and he want to earn money by me .. . and I think he charges extra from me
 (1) VERY POOR RESPONSE FOR COMPLAINTS. (2) HONOURING OF COMMITMENT BY STORES IS NOT UPTO THE MARK. (3) TEAM WORK AMONG VARIOUS VODAFONE ASSOCIATES / EXECUTIVES / OFFICERS IS NOT UPTO THE MARK.

Thanks vodafone for giving me a SMILE.
 Given wrong inputs regarding my prepaid account
 The people in Vodafone stores dont know how to handle their clients nor they know what are the latest policies of the company
 Everything is good when you visit the store . Phone support is terrible

 My resolution was quick without having to run here and there
 Very much
 100 out of 10
 70 percent
 Instead of 30 mins for activation it took nearly 24 hrs .
 I would have given 9 out 10, but I am not happy with the way one of the executives, Mr. Sandeep and the security interacted with me when I visited the store on 26 Dec 2014 for purchasing a dongle . Very happy with the way other executive Mr. Mandar interacted and took interest in resolving the issue on 30Dec 2014.
 My BIS still not working !
 I have already cleared outstanding but its really disappointing for me to company charge me extra amount .
 my bill is more than my usage and your staff could not help me with that, they just gave me a email address and told me to send email there
 Gud services
 Service was fast & without any hassle .
 The service personnel was excellent in providing the service needed but he made it look like he was doing those favours on his own behalf which made me f
 The staff didn't seem to understand what I was talking about when I explained I have blckberry phone nd need to use whatsapp, after somtime nd asking other coleugue he told me I had to call the help line because I have a mumbai no not a bangalore one . It didn't go any better on the phone so I wrote an email . I hope to receive a clear answer . Regards
 There Was no nano sim at jmd store
 Store associates are neither knowledgable nor have manners to deal with the customers .
 Excellent service by you
 The staff shnuld be courteous also can be a little helpful
 I VISITED VODAFONE STORE ACCORDING MASSAGE RECD FROM VK611117 ON 29 DEC 14 STORE REFUSE ME
 The service offered by the customer care is pathetic . Further, the store staff is very uncooperative and arrogant . I am thinking of porting out from voda
 Good
 Nice experience i had with your associate, totally super service keep an going with a good attitude
 Have to wait 1.30 hrs to get help .
 ng at the store but did not help me out . Even your store manager was not ready to listen anything . Moreover vodafone suddenly put my plan in the normal postpaid connection even when it was specifically taken under corporate user group . And after recieving the last bill now i got to know why suddenly my bill has increased . If something you are going to change with the customer's plan at least once you should inform him . These are the things which i would like to bring in your notice . Thank you .
 Got solution for my queries .
 Quick & friendly service
 Rocky gave me 1 of the best customer service experience i've ever had in my life . Very happy with vodafone but i'd appreciate if you guys could slash down your calling rates a little . Thanks, Sunil .
 Expectations are set at high level by ur ads
 This is second time I have faced hefty charges even when using data pack!! !
 Very active n supportive
 good
 good
 Untrained, inexperienced executives . No courtesy to customers . Information not forthcoming . Change of plan/tariff without information on my no .
 Your staff are extremely sales driven which is s total turn off
 I visited your vodafone store, located at Jmd regent square building, mg road, gurgaon, haryana.I wanted to opt for cug plan and went to enquire for thesame . The executive gave me all the wrong details as he was himself not aware of the plans and it's details.This wasted alot of my time and I was dissappointed
 am fully setisfied with your staff's behaviour and their quick response . Please keep it up .
 I visited your gallary alone , not knowing any procedure , but there was no one to assist , till one young boy who himself was waiting for his turn helped , that was the reason to give 5 to first question
 Waiting time was not long the lady explained everything clearly n did what had to be done quickly .
 Hi I want to convert my Vodafone sim to micro sim but Vodafone store given I don't care attitude n nt resolved my problem . Please do some action .
 Very dissatisfied
 It's fantastic and great to see ur commitment about my MNP
 I can say vodafone is best
 Store associate was good, I am happy with service but not happy with internet and with network .
 The persons attending the customers at your okhla branch didnt talk to us in a polite manner . Especially mr . Rajeev . Please do something about it .
 While converting postpaid to prepaid jb nagar vodafone store wanted original doc to verify of the address which was already verified for my postpaid no.Due to this reason they denied to process my request for postpaid to prepaid change which i believe is ridiculous
 My plan has been changed without my consent & I wanted to know why . But none could satisfy me .
 Your connectivity is good but your responce and attitude is not a PLUS factor .
 Store associate was having little knowledge abt how to convert individual connection to corporate . Thus he took sufficient time to do the needful . I haveto waste a lot of time there for a small piece of work
 Data services are not good and continuous . We need uninterrupted service .
 Nice service provide by mr kanik quick prblm solved
 Free
 ed if possible do something thanks
 Service was nice
 Satidfied
 I am not satisfied . Sorry for that .
 As the customer service executive very kind enough to give good services as this is the best service I could get first time in this store .
 Excessive usage charges have been applied
 Satisfactory
 Its' was nice
 Please don't open a store unless you have the required manpower
 It's all good service but I think strength of employees should be increase . Thanks
 U r the best
 D environment is good but self help section is not easy for all
 Provide more seating arrangements . Becauase if more clients in the office for enquiry . There is no space to sit properaly.nothing more

 Excellent service by the staff but this SMS system is annoying as taken seven hours to complete and takes too much of my time
 Best experience of the most of the most
 The person at the desk where i went for my query was very helpful and patient with the details of all my 3 numbers
 Nisha givn perfect and right information
 Finest service
 I added Rs.500 talk time credit and 1GB 3G internet to my phone . 2 days later I received a tex message saying 80% of my data was used up . 2 minutes afterreceiving this text I reviewed a second text saying all of my data was used up . 10 minutes after that all of my Rs.500 credit was gone .

 Your store employees are really very helpful and take care of customers .
 lan your executive is not able to find that offer at all
 I was a great experience visiting vodafone store and i was tottaly mesmerised by the way they respect the customers
 I was promised a credit of Rs 383 one month back which still hasn't happened . I was promised a call back from Mamta the store manager at hypercity whichI didn't receive . I was told that I wudnt get charged late fees but i still got charged . Horrendous experience
 VERY GOOD

 Poor services
 Horrible response

 Executives are very careless in attending the customer in malleshwaram branch . N i'm being a post paid customer why should i provide a address proof ? I have gone there to show them that i'm getting insert sim message . Without checking the issue how can the executive say that its problem with my mobile ? Please make them understand troubleshooting skills

 A person at your store is very helping nature and co-oprative and polite
 Good

 All employees were well spoken and helpful . The slight irritation arises from such a heavily bureaucratic system which requires so many papers for a simple SIM CHANGE.
 Good service
 Hi staff is well behaved and responce in proper way... . Helping staff. . Problem solved in a very short time . Atrective design of care . Thanks
 I gave a account closure request on 22nd and yesterday I get to know I received a call from yur representative on 26th that I told them I dont wish to close account as I am happy with yur service . This is a LIE. A fraud . Yur sales guys are cheating you . I received no call whatsoever and no one gave thisconfirmation . In your Parkstreet office there is a boy calld Biplab who misbehaved and spoke rudely and argued with me . Disgrace you have such people
 NICE
 Very satisfy
 ty which India needs so much and whenever I see honest people I admire them ur agent helped me and she was honest with her job she did not ignored the issue as before that my issue were ignored in other stores and she follow up my complaint and send my concern to higher authority more than once to help
 Very good experience
 Appreciated with the work
 Not going by token, different token no on screen and different being called out, priority executive did not know add a device feature details on red plans, gave me different explanation of my current plan vs other Vodafone store
 Microsoft 535 phone, 500 mb data free for 2 months . But until now, I didn't received the offer . I am loosing the trust of the company . If the starting is like this, what will be the future . Also I heard some complaints of some customers from your store while purchasing the sim . I don't think this type offeed backs make u Improve service . Thanks for giving an opportunity to purchase ur sim .
 Is was good
 Call me for details of dissatisfaction
 There cud ve been a better way of explaining things. . Displaying plan querries in detail wud be welcome . Also the increasing of plan fares without priorintimation to the consumer is also dissapointing practise . Thus.. .

 The agent was courteous and helpfull

 tomer service code customer sitting in front should have more priority than the one on phone !
 I wanted to change my SIM card from I phone 4 to I phone 6 . I send my peon and it was done in few minutes . The migration from 4 to 6 was seamless .
 Kindly solve the queries of customers as fast as, so that they don't need to wait for long time

 It's nice
 Good experience for years and the better services still continuing

 worst network and reply..good bye to this net
 We have waited almost 2 hours .. For each customer your executive takes 20-30min .. No sitting arrangements .. Employes we're acting like that it's our fault for being a Vodafone customer ..
 Shyam was very clear straight forward and helpful .
 Please make sure before change any plan & etc.. . To get confirm from correct person .

 I want to swap my no from postpaid to prepaid but your company just dont let me do it
 Customer dealing was not good.arrogant employees
 s ago they said it will be fix but it didn't again I went to CP store they change the sim but still no changes . So I finally decided to change my provider as you guys doesn't care about your customer . All I can say is very bad customer care service .
 Good
 Pl . See to it that whenever a customer comes to pay his or her bill, when they ask for an acknowledgement try to provide it as quick as possible . We have somany constraints tosay time mainly, hence we cld not xerox d bill etc . and we expect u to provide comfort for allthose things . And if possible have a separate counter for accepting payments and give a receipt though d paymemt is made through cheque . Thanks for ur enquiries and can i know to whomi am interacting with ?
 Very nice store and immediate resolution of issues . Nice n well groomed staff
 When I switchon 3G services, my mobile signal is being lost . No proper solution is given
 Very helpful
 Ur service is good . Is netpack activated 4r this postpaid number
 In writing bit difficult to express the experience . Give me a call
 Best
 Kindly provide technical knowledge( training)to store associates.just they are try to convince not to solve the problem .
 Good service n politeness n reasonable ratings for govt servants n HAPPY NEW YEAR IN ADVANCE TO VODAFONE

 Q2: 9
 Sorry to say,Voda Is not like that, a customer want, better services at affordable rates . To know for yourself, become a customer and compare all :_XX=BSNL_XX= RIL_XX= AIRTEL_XX= DOCOMO etc .
 fake commitment from your Vodafone center . misguided.big mouth world . so many time . pl check history
 Charger not working . Waiting period long . Inadequate seating . Network complaint .
 Ratings is totally based upon handling the customers which is quite gud..but siting arrangment is quite bad .
 Associate was very helpful
 Due to non availability of nano sim yey incrrctly cut a normal sim n gav me. . Which doesnt wrk .. Irritated. .
 Store associate was unaware of procedures, he was rude and unhelpful, does not tell me everything in first time and made me run to store 3 times, i alsoknow even u r part of the same system and u won't take any action to improve the system, u guys cant improve, u will continue to work in same manner.. .

 Thank you medam.megha
 My complaint was heared and put in system . Though it will take time to resolve but process has started
 There is no one who attend a customer properly . If I hear this answer from your representative please call on 111 for any queries then why Vodafone openthese stores . I am using this no of Vodafone from 10 years but now I want to port out because of your poor service & network problem
 Your executive does not have value of a customer, they are interest only for there tea coffee breaks each person wants to say its not my work talk to some one else . I had a very bad experience in my last two visit . One lady is there to stop connections she never know how to talk with customer i forget her name actually i want to complain all this but i don't have time to talk your sm .

 Because I am very satisfied
 I am billed wrongly . No satisfying explanation . I need some light on that and bills been sent to the wrong address . I allready complained . No response yet .
 Friendly and warm welcome . Clear answers were given highlighting the benefits that are provided with comparision .
 I'm really unhappy with the service I got . I was in a query but your associate did not even try to understand what I was saying . I am very annoyed with this service .
 Quick nd politely response by executive
 Each and every customer that I had seen on your bandra store is unsatisfied in my opinion coz everyone seems to be complaining about the service providedby your ******* staff....the feel they give about them seems like they are the owner of Vodafone...finally false claim had been given to me....regardingmy postpaid to prepaid connection.... . 280 they have charged and told that I will receive 250 talk time but till date I haven't received it... . FinallyI must say that I haven't expected this kind of stuff from big brand like Vodafone... . If this seem to be the case in future sadly I have to MNP my service provider to AIRTEL
 Good experience
 Your service is very quike and representatives are co operative .
 nobody solve my problem last 3 year....finally going to portability with other mobile operator... .
 gud
 Good and quickly service .;-)
 Vodafone as a telecom operator on the whole makes too many promises and keeps up to barely any Customers need to repeatedly visit you, be patient, and doall the needful that ideally you as a service provider should be doing if tour customer is facing trouble Attendants are polite but not of much help when actually needed Thank you
 I am not satisfied with the information given regarding the query I had. .
 Teach you employee basic behaviour
 Reasons Q1: Should be more innovative in making economical plans for customers . some of your compitetators are ahead of you in this aspect . Q2: Store exp is very good . Would be much better if the man power is more in that store to reduce the waiting time of customers . Q3: Store Associate is very proacti

 I entered the store took my token number and within a couple of minutes i was called.. . also the executive who attended to me was very helpful and sugges
 I like very much vodafone service with nice approach .
 Gud service
 In ur 1st bill there was descripancy . Rs 26 for SMS charged wrongly, hence the visit . She listened to my reasoning and agreed to forward for refund . Whythis transperancy problem in the very first bill ? She was very polite . Your other staff was also co operative . You should maintain your reputation high .
 Turnaround time is pathetic . Answers are round and round . Reasons are unbelievable . Most of your persons don't know the exact solutions and still they try to answer . Have already visited one of your other store in raghuleela mall, there it's more nightmare . I repeat turnaround time is hugely irritating .

 Some of your front office executive are very rude,
 Service was good at the store . I completely satisfied with the associate .
 The way , yr rep. Solved my queries was so true that i had given 9 out of 10,eventhough he deserves 10.
 Very clean, systematic, enthusiasm atmosphere at stores, thanq

 Very satisfied
 Attractive interaction n beautiful bonding.. . The way they treat n handle problem is good.. . Really impressive
 How can a person go to change a SIM to other city where that was bought . Rules are not practical .
 I needed some help . Vodafone people were very helpful and cooperative . Hence these ratings .
 Hari is very good because any problem hari are suggest and solution very well done . and vodafone company i request please promote upper post Hari
 Opaque and deliberate pricing . Extremely poor management if customers . Vivek at the call centre was awful .vijay at shop tried to retrieve matters . Theproblem remains with Vodafone s intent which seems to be to overcharge by stealth

 From 2nd November 2014 I had been to your vijaynagar stores to activate smart pay and gave all my documents to Madhu, and till date he had not processedsmart pay on my connection due to which am getting payment reminder calls and also his attitude towards resolving concern is not acceptable ..
 He is very talented any any problem suggested well

 Good response from the Vodafone executive
 It seems close to impossible to change my talk plan with Vodafone . I plan to stop using ur service
 It's taking too much Time in activation .. Stupid reason no generator
 Dear Sir, I am a regular user of promo cards, such as 59..ect . This promo transfer my call rates in seconds . But by mistake this time I had recharged mynumber with a wrong promo card of Rs.62/- which had activated some roaming call charges facility . But from then l was not able to recharge any other promos . Every time the recharged fail & my call rates has been gone up . So! I went to your Vodafone store, to make the complain . They assured me, that matter
 Because in vodafone store especially find great service with proper resolution .
 Good service
 I hv got what I was looking for and too on imediate basis so I gave this rating
 I met with Mr. Vivek Gupta and he is very good and helpful in nature .

 Customer dealing is poor customer suffer from issues mr raman in your store convinced me to port the numbers d i have converted two no into vodafone post
 1. Insufficient siting chairs for waiting area . 2. Less informed executive .
 NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROVIDED BY COMPANY ASSOCIATES.
 experience was nice (Y)
 ThanQ for handling customers very politely .
 I am satisfied but your security is beyond of courtship, system of placement of customer to your dealing assistant is to be developed, seat capacity forthe waiter is to be increased . Thank you

 Staffs keep pending docs without processing . TAT too high
 Good service
 I m very happy with service of priya awasthi

 I need not to wait in store P.Chaudhary
 l went there to change my sim _a`nd it got changed without any interruption
 Most unhelpful people as I visited three stores of nashik
 Off late there are several issues popping up . 1. Top of chart is your service . Call it network congestion or anything else but there is escape to the fact that your network has touched worst extremes . Be it 3G in roaming, call drops, poor network strength . 2. Second is the billing related issues .
 My query not replied
 Good
 Store executive solved problem
 Once having recieved the token, there was confusion till my number was called out multiple times . I couldnt know how much time I needed to wait till itwas my number . While leaving the store I realised that there was a screen showing the current number but it was hidden from general public view
 The concerned person activated my outgoing calls .
 My issue is not solved i m so much fad up by ur store associates knowledge nd by the vodafone facility
 Very nice
 fast responce, accuracy in work
 Very good attitude got nice response .
 I got bigg issue in my billing i thought extra chrges are i got, Bt pramitha was explnd me clearly billdetails.exlnt service keep it up pramitha good job
 Just open more stores.. . else you are going good
 I wantd to have micro sim of my number but dre i cme to knw dat my 4 yr old prepaid number is nt on my name so they denied givng me prepaid micro sim nwunfortunately i have to port my number to sm other provider
 As it was my first experience I got good response and polite interaction with me of your representative
 The overall experience was good . They understood my requirements and promptly acted .
 You need to improve in the field of 3G networking to compit with others like Airtel, Idea...I wish a happy new year to all of you .
 Realy mindblowing stor & prasentation realy super amazin
 Unsatisfied with the billing amount
 As i was there for around 45 min , i felt that few executives were not customer friendly . They were interrogating like CID officer. You should teach them to be polite to the customers
 Excellent response and swift activation
 Always very helpful .
 Pla improve your service and staff working style

 Good experience in vodafone store (barasat)..Subhankar & Santanu are very very careful and understand the problem and they solved it..nice experience .
 The overall experience was excellent and the executive responeded promptly to my queries .
 No one simply care's for the customer . They are busy in themselves . What can be done in 2 - 5 mins they will do it in 20 mins .

 VODAFONE IS A VERY FAST I.AM SATISFIED, YOUR SERVICE GOOD I, APRITIATE TO U
 It was nice experience , and i love vodafone as far as connectivity is concerned .  But still rates of internet are very high, please try to reduce them .
 no i m not understand
 At Store which i visited, the store associate is not hearing my words and he is only interested to sell a new connection to me, while he first has to resolve my issue with current sim card . also when i refused to take new postpaid sim card his tone changed and he is showing his anger to me .
 I went there with a problem, which was solved instantly and hence this rating
 Quick and efficient service .
 Store has a friendly atmosphere. . I would love to visit again in case of any assistance needed
 First of all, payment made ten days back but though online but still service was disconnected even after updating the transaction ID two times . This visit itself is unnecessary during month end busy schedule . Kindly take care in future to avoid these kind of issues
 Customer Care representative were courteous .
 I am using vodafone for many years without much complaints . Store is maintained well and systematic . Store assistants was very polite patient and veryattentive to support all my quarries and iam very satisfied with her service and support . Your signal at DLF cyber city is very poor . One negative point .
 Improve token sys.staf to be more caring
 Good
 Very helpfully. . and very smart..good character .
 The reason is non waiting . For complaints quick solutions and . The rest we all knw..... .
 It was real convenient and helpful as per my needs .
 They don't know proper way to solve the problem, trying to skip problem in that time .
 Resource shortage, too much waiting time
 not much detailed information was given
 Courtesy,speed and politeness
 This is based on experience with your associate on the show room so far .
 the staff is completely irresponsible nd not competent to understand customer probs there is no such thing as customer care at this store specially mrVinod
 Very very good service
 Associates seems to be confused about the action reqd . Also some othr customers were furious abt the slack of services .
 Very good service
 People at counter were have little less confidence, than need to coordinate with seniors .
 Good service Thanx voda
 Superb handling of customers
 Ratings were dependent on the overall service .

 No service no internet only bills .
 Effective courteous kind are messages charged today pl do not send messages in the night happy new year
 staff member Inzhar tried to fool me by saying my Sim card was damaged, when it wasn't . His intent was to extort money to expedite
 The reception was warm, understanding and the resolution was satisfying
 I have a corporate connection and I want to change MICRO SIM to NANO SIM. My total interactions with VF is 4 times . Once in phone and 3 store visits . I spent approx 3.5 hrs . When we talk about customer experience do you think it's acceptable ? As you don't have proper processes and staff is not helping thecustomers you end up spending more OPEX per customer interaction . I stay with VF as its a corporate account . For this kind of experience I had I would switch to another provider if I have private connection !
 Gud service
 first thing is u need to increase your no . of stores as there is always rush in ur stores .& 2nd to give more options online so as to reduce store visit .
 Good executive
 Timely support rendered and patiently hearing my problem .
 Overall was ok but increase ur staff and hospitality service as well
 Happy new year
 My query is easy clear to that girl...good smile and good serives.... .
 Thanks
 st billings dispute about my big bills ..
 Quick respond good for us
 Quality of the representative interaction, right from grooming skills to communication skills were clear gaps
 Totally satisfied .
 The executives were very helpful . My suggestion is that provide a number which will directly connect to customer care . There's shouldn't be press 1 & press 2.
 Good
 Emloyees behevior are very good & I appriciat him
 associates solved my problel as soon as posssible . i realyenjoyed the service
 t to get things done was undertaken .
 With out acceptance revised the plan .m ur valuable costumer u have to provide better plan but always cost cutting .shame on u
 I had good experience & the executive handles the customer like friend good service . In store there is no space for customers to sit .
 I was apply for change of my postpaid ownership in May 2014. After lots of follow-up and hurdles I got change of ownership in December 2014. Very unresponsive system . This time I came for microsim . They told me plz give NGOs letter and ID. I m there, my ID, my Sim with me . You need only replace my Sim with micro sim . Did you think this is the best services of your Vodafone in Bhuj ?
 Only promises .. No action.. . Fed up with Vodafone services after 8 years . All false commitment .
 Overol experience was good
 Long story . Pls speak to me if you are truly bothered about customer feedback .
 Im really proud to be vodf cus
 I had taken net pack , but last 2 month cintiunusly got extra downloding charges , and they r not ready to explain , wht i had downloads , actually i never use net for any downloding , now they told that if u have problem with service , u closed the service of Internet . so i deactivate the service
 He suggested to me get corporate plan, because I am working with maersk global service Ltd .
 Store members don't know the time value of customers
 No comments.all is well
 Good one
 I have not satisfied working of store associate . We have take the form after given direction, filled & wait 30 minut and submit two next stages . During form submisson three associates intracted with us instead of one .
 Bindaas
 So i decided 2 port out
 None
 i m very satisfied with vodafone service
 Ok thank u
 Improve your service
 Responsiblity...should...take care customer
 Good experience
 The people who r there fr help of customers r totally irresponsible
 Y
 ut she was smiling at some of her co worker and completely ignored what I was trying to say . Though she was present in the store physically but mentallyshe was absent as a result she could not understand my need and advised me some plan which made no sense to me . Any one would expect good service from brand like Vodafone but my experience was sad . Ravi
 Becoz of vodafone is my best opinion and also service .
 Staff was very pleasant n helpful to solve my problem
 Bcozz i will talking to Vodafone store service provider he will behave me very poor And My problem was not solved from last 21 days
 The reason for my ratings are The person I visited had clarified all my douts . The time taken for this is also less than 2 min . Tbe association with your staff was good .
 Had to wait a long time to be attended . Explanations were not fully satisfactory .
 I went to the shop to change my caller tune my new caller tune will be AMAR BHITOR BAHIRE by sahaj ma but i became very much surprise and angry that my service provider has no stock of such a jewel creation of rudra there fore initially i rated my provider not my friend who helped me to know my providersactual capacity
 No response at store . Please call me .
 Good
 Always very very good
 There is no advantage for customers, who have been with Vodafone since a long time . Unnecessary charges had been charged and no roaming benefits are available to communicate between CUG numbers while on roaming .
 Overall it's good to see a customer service center like this with token system and immediat attention
 Cool & awesome quck fast servc
 Mobile network cost is high
 The executives at the store were soft spoken and swift in action . It took only five minutes for registering new email I D and getting hard copy of previous months bill . The executives really deserve the Appreciation .
 An above average experience . Than you
 Happy with Vodafone as I have no problems
 Good keepit up
 His respond s very good He explain very clearly that s very satisfied to me Interaction wit customers s nice
 Right ans
 Vry good
 Don't have knowledge for plan
 It was very nice to visited vodafone store .
 There was a shortest wait . The person was new to the job but he dealt with my complaint promptly . Now I have to see how soon the problem is rectified . Thanks . Abdulla Basha V.
 This is realy a good service
 Stores service very good technical service of your head office is poor
 Good service
 Poor service, am planing 2 migrate 2 alternate network
 10/10
 Iam not satisfid, mx problem war not soloved . So i desided that i port out from vodafone .
 Reception at the store, politeness to my queries and technical competiness in resolving the customers issues experienced your store is of excellent standard .
 We were served by Ektra who was charming & extremely efficient . She established our needs quickly & worked hard to ensure they were met . She made our experience worth 10. She is worth 10 to Vodaphone !
 Not good
 Good reponding and quick service
 Nic i am alwayes using this
 Good
 because of her...thank u
 Instead of micro Sim they gave normal Sim..I had to visit the store 3 times
 Service fast
 We were not informed of the charges and staffs were not polite
 Best service
 It was wonderful experience . Attention was prompt and effective . The executives took interest in solving my problems fast .
 Very dissapointed with your network coverage
 Very much appreciating for understanding our problem and quick decion to clear the same .
 5/.4. . Make local cals n std reasnble price . N gud mor ofers for custumares , atractive ofers . . And network coverage , means no network problams, and postpaid costemars no late paymnt fees . .tank u. .
 Kaimz nice people

 It took 4 days and a total replacement of 4 SIM cards to get my number active..support staff was very helpful but the experience was not nice at all as I
 Being old Costomer new offers denied . It is wrong that I'm old Costomer though no where written on your Vodafone brouchure
 Gud
 Nice store and good location, am happy to say
 Prompt enquiring looks n attn
 I didn't undrstand the reasons for varying ur words . Y shall I pay any advance rental when I m using postpaid .
 Service is good . But token system needs to be made more efficient .
 wrong) . If these feedback really matters then pls do feel free to call me so that I will be able to narrate my whole experience .
 Could not get the actual problem resolved . Other representative of Vodafone resolved it .
 The representative was good and helped me alot. . With most of my queries. . But seems he was no equipped to answer my some querry. . But will rate him 10/10!!  This rating is purely for the rep and not as Vodafone customer . If i had to rate Vodafone the rating will go on negative . !! !
 Hassle free service
 I coveted my sim from post paid to pre paid . And still waiting for refund amount after 6 months also . Very dissatisfied .
 I HAVE VISITED ABIDS VOD STORE MORE THAN ONCE AND GOT GOOD RESPONSE FROM THE OPERATOR.SHE WAS A LADY.SHE GUIDED WELL TO ALL MY QUIRIES.AND ONE MORE QUERYIS DUE TO SOLVE AS IT TAKES SOME TIME.I HOPE SHE WILL MANAGE IT AS WELL.I WILL FURTHER APPRECIATE IF MY PENDING QUERY IS SOLVED FROM YOUR SIDE.COMMUNICATION SKILLS WERE HIGHLY APPRECIABLE.I REQUEST THE LADY OPERATOR TO BE GIVEN FURTHER HIGHER POST.
 Its a very good company
 Pay*
 The waiting period was least . Work was done to my satisfaction . Staff was very supportive and helpful .
 Time consuming and huh don't tell me new plans
 Good service
 I love vodafone
 to vodafone .
 e staff . Even the service agent was unable to handle my problem
 Initially the lady who approached me when I was taking the token was very weak with the communications and later when I told her I want a nano card for my iPhone with my same no which is on my husbands name she directly denied saying my husbAnd should personally come to store (whereas I told her initiallythat he is aboard at UK )without giving me any alternate option then when I again approach her she asked me to speak to the executives sitting there which she could have done in first instant if she had incomplete info. . Then the executive guided me for solution of an email to be sent from my husband which can help which proved helpful to me . But I strongly suggest there was no soft spoken skills either with the lady nor with the executive . My suggestion would be customers should be treated warmly and with smiling face and not just for formality sake .
 Security guards at door response not satisfied .
 services of this company . I have been charged unnecessary for last two months .
 ay past closing time . The staff was friendly courteous and helpful especially Mr. Subhrangshu Roy . A great on time help . So thank you
 Your store assistant really helped me in getting my connection reinstated . Store ambiancr was not customer friendly . Extremely Unhappy with vodafone, dueexcessive billing & poor / delayed response from nodel officer. Charges r not as per the net pack selected by me (299). Opted gor portability . Thank you .
 ing my visit to vodafone store
 It was nice experience and my queries were solved in moments .
 The CCE satisfied my requirements and provided complete information regarding my queries . The behavior of CCE was very good and helpful .
 All customers always fight bcoz of this . Better Vodafone company close this Shahibaug Store . Just visit as a fake client and see what happen there .
 Loves to be a Vodafone customer as with all the executive knows how to take care without being irritated and being calm . ...keep up the good work
 Excellent service & happy new year in advance
 I felt @ home !
 No comments excellent staff amd very good manner and professionalism Highly impressed
 Whenever i enter the store,someone comes forward to help me out . I can freely disturb anybody for any enquiry . Your staff are very friendly .
 Excellent, was very helpful always Ready to Help and Eager to assist . He helped me with the proper settings to surf internet on my Nokia, Less Wating,Love 2 Recommend
 Awesome experience

 Very poor service
 Good service . Rating of 8
 Very poor service and customer service executive does not have experience and no knowledge about customer care service and lots to negligence from Vodafo
 While sending reply, I get rrply "Invalid Number"
 My worst experience I met in your two stores of vijayawada , the people don't know how to treat with post paid customer and finally I decided to go MNP
 Best
 U pl give a reply on what action u will take to reduce the waiting period whereby customers waiting is reduced and will b happy to shsre their experience
 1. Long queue, 2. Charges to prepaid customer for sim replacement .
 Is was not a vodafone store..it was total mess . Custmer care executive not bothered to deal with customer in sequance . They were dealing unethically . Onestaff was visitng to every customer waitng and knowing wat d issu is and he was arrang d order personaly .

 The people at your gallery don't have proper answers to the queries . And they end up telling the same thing . The final reply received was we cannot do anything about it . Now I don't know where to seek redressal .
 Not so Good
 Sad but true

 All thing iz well and i will give 10 no frm 10 no
 Pls let me know what documents required for getting a prepaid connection then I wil text u my experience

 Nice . Very good . Ossom . Loved it . Abhilash Sharma is a great guy .

 Behaviour was disgusting , she was talking in such a manner that she is FBI officer and i am terriost, worst service experience
 I came at voda store 3 times but i didn't get any benefit frm thr.. . So some Action should be taken immediately. . On the spot... .
 4/5
 You guys **** at providing service, you are a money minded company and do not care about customer satisfaction .

 Feedback is store staff is poor at customer service and were busy chatting amongst them or attending to personal calls . Pathetic
 Agents were trying to send me to customer service rather than resolve the issue
 Firstly, vodafone red is only for new customers . Why do old customers have to pay more Secondly, wrong charges levied for two months Thirdly, all complaints made over the phone ignored Lastly, waiting time of upto two hours in a lot of vodafone customer care centres
 Waiting was quite long . However the Store Associate was very helpful .
 Vodafone is so expensive and fraud . i am also employee of this bt get tired of this . i hate vodafone .
 If you want, feel free to call for the detailed experience
 I had to wait for an hour from 4 to 5 pm for my token to be displayed at PM Road Fort gallery; for work which was not of even 5 minutes and attributableto company's fault .
 Refer to complaint no 1643595552
 This is better
 Very helpful excellent service
 Visited Vodafone store four times but bill dispute still not solved.. . false promises made of call back within 2 days of store visit.. . pathetic service
 I am very satisfied overall SERVICE EXPERIENCE in our Vodafone store, good job
 No responsible reply with firm commitment from anyone regarding resolution of my complaint for wrong bill, concern for poor network coverage at my home and request for change of irresponsible and non responsive relationship manager .
 Your staff just give commitment and we trust them not trust worthy staff on your call centre seriously not satisfied and have no time or else have port out to other network
 Behaviour was good . The reasons were good . But i was unhappy because i did not get ans for my question
 Not satisfied with your service, over charging in bill not feed back on complains
 I Dint get my solution.. .
 dafone

 Q4,....reply- I think every details,experienc e,etc has been shared with u
 Sir dnt barre the calls when credit limit crosses just extend the time to pay the bill thank you
 CCE was having entire knowledge and was supportive .
 Wasted 45 days and did nt act to conclude my assured reversal of charges causing me immense mental agony and precious time and physical torture.a very bad experience fr Vodafone .
 I have been to your mini store to buy micro SIM card for my new handset
 My problem is not solved yet.. . On the basis of staff knowledge and time taken to solve the problem. .
 I like your service, The way your executive handle the customer is really nice .
 Excellent service .
 The service was good however I am a bit disappointed as it is 24 hours but my phone is still not activated .
 Sir, about my experince I have told to your customer care . Their service is not prompt . Also not getting proper network near my home . Confusion abt charges and plan .

 I went to activate roam like home service . But the attendant didn't know anything . When I asked his full name for reference . He denied . I called for themanager . Who said he will get it done in 48hrs after a long talk . Really unhappy with the experience . Airtel was better . Can someone pls help . Thanks .
 Very satisfied
 I did not got a proper & positive reply about my problems & issues from vodafone coustomer care as well as vodafone store .
 Plzz send me a confirmation message of activation of net card and if it is not yet activated then activate it as soon as possible
 ciates took a 5 to 7 min break after tackling each customer . They would just go in the inner office for the break . Bad experience .
 There was total mismatch of behavior before i purchase the simcard and after i paid the money to purchase . There were plans activated on my number which
 I am with your co since the beginning and have enjoyed trouble free services throughout Thanks
 According to my knowledge VADAFONE STAFF MOST UNDER STANDING MOST HELPFUL
 Not satisfied with the services vodafone provides
 I am not satisfied with your service
 Good
 The reason is that the gift u have given an android speaker is damaged pieced so u kindly help me out
 Vodafone provides excellent service .
 Good staff & they are trying very hard but the volumes of requests are obviously huge; a more innovative approach to handling requests, payments etc is required .
 Thanx for hlping
 Well behibiour,well manared office attend makes ur store more attractive
 Dissatisfied
 Call me
 for their doings .
 I took this post-paid offer after attending several phone calls from yr some Mr. Vadrak who conveyed part & some untrue information which I came to knowafter visiting yr mini store & store . I hv been harrassed a lot & am spending money and time due to this act of yr irresponsible agent Mr. Vadrak . Pl arrange to stop this sort of business immediately .
 Jjjjjjjjjjjj
 awesome service yes am fully satisfied
 Why it is still showing what sap error
 Vodafone net speed is poor compare other network
 The token system is slow, it delays the overall time taken to resolve/advise . Token system should be for queries actually requiring human interaction
 good but 3g speed is not good as compare to other
 Very fine . Easy operations user friendfly gui ,  what else required ?
 Services at different levels that I went thru were good
 Store associate was very much up to the point . It took me less tym to enquire my billing and VF charges but also got useful info on data usage plan charges .
 We have found that your network at Pune is totally bad & there seems to be no action to improve it . We are totally cut off in communication
 Data plan of 249 was refilled on my number but yet not activated by vodafone . The main balance is getting deducted if internet is used . I am fed up of vodafone service and would never suggest anyone to go for it . The PR at vodafone has least knowledge on how to solve the problem .
 Good customer interaction . Ability to understand the customer requirement and laying out solutions . Much better interface
 Your networks is very so low.I will very disappoint .
 I waited for an hour before my turn came . The process was all manuel n there was no display of sequence . Front line officer (Rahul) was rude n did not have etiquettes to be courteous with customers .
 You fool customers for money by increasing their monthly without knowledge and don't resolve complaints .
 Lots of chaos at the store No quick service
 My task assigned 20 days ago is still pending,i was assure that it will be done in 3 days but isnt.... ?
 For all questions of your stors
 I realy get good help regarding services . Thqnk u very much
 *Had to wait for long *No proper sittsitting arrangement *No proper hospitality *No proper information given easily
 Vodafone is good .
 ITS MANY TIMES I WENT TO VODAFONE STORE BUT MY PROBLEM IS STILL UNRESOLVED
 I really had a nice experiance at vodaphone store . staffs are very helpful and answered my questions patienly . And rectified my problem soon . But thereis room for little improuement .
 Still not satisfied... .
 Good response.i am happy with ur store service.very gud smile
 Good personality and behavour to me.. . I knw abut postpaid connectn and its benifit frm her
 Ms Sandhya at your Churchgate store was able to understand and apprevciate my problem and rewuorement and workef on itt instantly . During June this yeartoo,when other staff at your Santacrux West n Churchgate stores were not able to handle the,problem, Sandhysji resolved the issue promptly.I think attitude is the main thing
 Handle the customer's what is there need and problems .
 Very likely
 Please look forward towards on desk service cause out of 7 desk only 3 are active at a time so it results into lots of waiting .
 Good .. .
 1. The call rates have been abruptly increased . 2. Often network problem is faced...esp. in inside rooms . 3. Common offers are discontinued .
 I had requested for a internet pack to be added which is still not done...is it because u all want me to keep paying extra for the Internet charges
 Because still my free internet pack is not activated .
 Very very good experience on Vodafone Sion especially Mr Sameer has given fabulous services he has a very good knowledge very good thanks
 Helpful n gud
 By the Vodafone my problems are not solve From last 20 days
 It was a good experience .but had to wait for 1 hour for my turn .
 Inviting world class showroom and ambience.and reachability and friendly staff with clarity in explanation to my queries
 The service was quick and prompt and hasslefree
 I am visiting vodofone store 4 to 5 times just to wave of the charges which have been deducted without my notice, but still now not received any wavier
 Mr. Shiv gave me a good attention and listen me seriously otherwise i talk to your average employees till now . Best Regards, Vijay Sharma
 Long queue waited for more than 1 hour limited staff
 D
 For your thought .......happy to help
 Please make sure during disconnection entire final settlement amount is disclosed to the customer and there no bill generation post disconnection date . Pathetic system where bill generation happens even after disconnection . The final settlement amount SHOULD include ALL unbilled amounts and monthly PRO-RATA charges .
 Service was nice
 The whole reason of visiting the store was worthless . I did not get any proper solution to my problem . So no more vodafone !
 very good work
 I have discontinued post paid system and applied for prepaid of your vodafone . Hope this will be started soon . Thanks .
 Waiting time was too much , 45 minutes . Otherwise service is good .
 The person with whom I interacted he helped me to change the owner ship of the sim . His attitude was very good . I didn't hasitate to have a talk with him .
 As I went for the name transfer of my mobile . Every Time I was told this paper won't work . U bring This n u bring that at the last moment . I was disappointed as I went 4 times for my work nd still my work is incomplete .
 **** more and more competitive . Month end it's always issue they say . So solve it .
 As i said before it'll take too much time for some little query .
 Good
 It was quite satisfactory experience , all were helpful and cooperative .
 Very good
 she is excelent
 verice in this area over the last 4/5 months has been going down . Either there is excessive load on the installation or maintenance of system is not as it should be . As a result calls gets disconnected and have low audibility due to weak signal . Pl . attend to these aspects in keeping with your earlier reputation as a leading international provider .
 I am not satisfied with the service
 Vodafone is not giving proper network in my area..which i hv so much calling, voice craking on cals...as i already visited voda . Stores many time bt it i
 Fine
 Waste fellows doesnt understand the problem and suggested me to change the sim and told me that there is no stock and visit nxt store but actually it isa simple setting which i doesnt knw but my frnd know that . So i am using the same sim and texting u people
 Behaviour.dealing.speedy working, highly satsfied
 Thnx to help me" bcoz ths is the important sim fr me nd also thnx to miss tripti !
 When I called up helpline it was polite conversation . At the shop it was smart resolution .
 Executive was so helpful :)

 Visiting store is very time consuming, there are lots of customers with queries but having less staff members or counters its take long time for waitingown turn so i'll not prefer to visit store :(Visiting store is very time consuming, there are lots of customers with queries but having less staff members or counters its take long time for waiting
 Very satisfied
 Not happy
 Desk person is not updated with current offers and inclusions
 It was a wow experience . The store associate helped me vry well with my queries nd plan . Satisfied with the service . We recommend to my friends and family .
 Good
 .LLS GUD. NO COMMENT AS SUCH. IMP REMARK. PL KINDLY MAKE SURE THAT THE PAYMEMENT DONE REMARK REABHES Y INFO. DESK. THE VODAF CALLERS EAT R HEADS TO CONFMAGAIN AND AGAIN
 Internet connection /network is not upto the mark
 I would say it's the people who are brand or service centre representative . The behaviour or the way of dealing was highly unexpectable. .
 They all were very helpful understanding and cooperative and I was very impressed . Hope they keep this up
 It helped the fact that the Dahisar gallery wasn't crowded however no seating arrangement for people who are waiting for their token no . Would be good tohave some basic seating arrangements
 Very good service given by your cce
 Customer service at the store was pathetic and has always been like this . No courtesy at all.. .
 The waiting time was for now than 2 hrs, and people were more than SAD to help, and this us not the first time its always like this at this particular store .
 Vodafone is incorrectly and fraudulently applying charges to customers accounts, towards internet usage . I have an unlimited internet plan, but have beencharges amounts towards downloads against actions not executed (almost twice as much as my internet usage fee) . I'm convinced these are consciously anddeliberately applied as it's just 'slipped into' the bill . While Sunil helped resolve this particular instance; I would not recommend Vodafone to anyonegiven the deliberate and intentional fraudulent charges . Infact, I'm considering porting out, myself !
 Ambiance is good peoper knowledge
 1 good
 Lack of knowledge regarding product n services
 Free
 The Associate was very polite and helpful to make me understand my issue and tried to gave the best resolution .
 Delay in action taking and prompt reaponse.no care for customer .bad attitude of customer care executives .
 Very good
 The associates who came to my home promised me diff things which store pple were unaware of .
 Your vodafone store & customer care executive service are pathetic . People standing in long cues and customer care people roaming here n there rather than work .
 Nice
 It was good
 It was helpful and they care on customer very good
 Ur services are OK, Happy to Help motto is good but is it being implemented I had a good exp standing for 15 minutes n all the way most of them were waiting ki mera number kab ayega . Sr . Citizens should be helped not pushed aside . Advance New Year Wishes that U become Orange again .
 eeeeery Haaaaaaaappy New Year to alll . .. .
 Service good if a customer opted for a immediate plan change it should affect from the next 24 hours
 I bought a new sim Card and got it activated yesterday still my account balance is 0 despite the fact that I spent 700 rupees . The current response is that the server is having technical difficulties . Hope this is solved soon
 Superb
 You should provide a reasonable sitting place for people waiting for their turn. . your staff is quite co operative and helpful...your clientele has grownin number..So pl ensure that we have not to wait for long time...All the best in new year.. .

 Good service and nice store
 Am very happy with see executive polite attitude
 Miss . Sneha doing a gr8 job . All d best .
 My problem was not solved . There was too much of a communication gap . End of the day, Vodafone wins, gets our money !
 NETWORK IS GOOD BUT STORE ASSOCIATE NOT GOOD
 Long wait to get the service
 for 2 months
 Improve your servicess !
 Lack of customer service culture, no responsibility and no timeliness
 No one seemed to interested in helping . No communication at all you have to make effort to find out everything .
 HE IS VERY NICE& REPLCE MY SIM VERY FAST
 They were not at all cooperative..and also senior citizen should be given priority. .
 ible service . Pls train staff before launching a product.
 Ur ahmedabad stadium store manager was an absolute waste, arrogant and so was binta - the customer service executive .
 I want to reduce my phone bills I was offered Vodafone red I am calling from one week no one is helping me out finally I went to your store they too nothelping
 vodafone stores were not further helping the customer they even cannot listen customers
 The three replies say it all . Getting to a person ell is time wasting Asia takes too long
 They provide information regarding my concern 100% not satisfied . They take care & humble to speak . Thats why i gave that much of rating .
 Nice nd coprative staff, my pleasure to be a vodafone custmore .
 Queue wait time was long . Agents were unprofessional - seemed like they had no sense of urgency; were joking about other customers in front of everyone.They were nice to me but rude to few other customers . Agents can 'smile' more and show that they are really happy to serve .
 am satisfied with your service
 Handling kindly . Good atmosphere
 Gud service
 Cash counter took Rs.180 for RC159, but when i got connection 2 days later talk time was '0' . He corrected the mistake only after/because i visited thecentre again .

And also i had issue with vodafore earlier which i shared with her she assured me that i will take care of this and i ll makesure your things gets resolved properly.So the way she answered all my queries in well mannererd .

 My problem is not solve yet
 Your services and responses **** Ajanta
 Soft anf prompt approach to tackle the problems .
 Immediate response and prompt action to solve customers grievan es as fast as possible .
 Experience is very bad, choose 1 plan, billing other plans
 Delay in attending and servicing
 Good store good interaction and i am happy for your serve
 The associates at the store were not professional . E.g accepting personal calls when customer queries were still being sorted .
 I am not against Vodafone local executives . But the corporate people who call on phone are cheaters.. . To sell product they misguide people . Be dare enough to accept mistakes on company side and prevent losing customers .
 When i give a request for activation or deactivationfor a servicedo give a sms confirmation that my service is activated or deactivated which i never receive
 Service provide by the associate is excellent because of his hard work I m very happy and rating 10 on 10
 Total chaos...no one is aware of the process...had to wait for 20 min for the in charge to come and she also took a while to confirm and close my requirement.. .
 Our interaction was very good but the officials standing at the main cabin were not answering us properly .
 U want still to improve customer interaction
 Irresponsible totally
 The staff gives very good Service & especially one Mr. Afzal s' response to Customer s' is very fine Totaly the store is very good
 Everyone were very co-operatve and fast which have saved my time which is very appreciative .
 Sir in last four month bill I was charged for downloading . Next my plan is of Rs199 which is later changed to 249 automatically . And atlast there should
 Executive are so careless I went to store 3-4 times then my number started . It's a very bad experience and worst experience I had ever . I want to port my number
 Very excellent
 There should be one more person who asked to customers to there problems . One person is there but not attend me infact he was talking to other person . When i visit there and asked a person to help me he send me to another person . Then the next one is send me to another one . And once again he send me to an
 There was some technical problem no data of mine was entered properly . I was left with no connection for 2 and half days even your call centre could notlf
 Looking forward for 4G at reasonable price for unlimited data usage .
 Do some thing extra ordinary
 Vodafone is a cheater . U have internal communication gap . U don't know how to follow your commitments. . worst service i ever get . I am planning for portablity
 Good
 Quick services
 I had questions on 4 numbers out of which one number is still pending for solution
 Good service
 Apart from waiting time at the store, the experience was gud . They made me understand everything easily .
 I lodged a complaint they heard it patiently and assured me to solve it .
 Overall my experience with Vodafone centre is good .thank u guys
 Very very average service .
 Very Bad Look, No Concentrate To Work No Response To Customer Her Missed Some Good Activities .
 Superb n good service
 1 Although all the counters were idle i was made to wait 2 even after calling me the official spent some time talking / attending some pspers 3 the problem was rectified without any ecplainatipn to me
 You are the worst network and and worst polices so that you can grab the money of your customers you are the biggest cheater in telecom industry .
 Good
 While your store resolved my problems of call drop, hanging and blank outs and also enabled ISD connection, these were long due . I had been requesting your call centre associates who would call me over the last 7 to 8 months to resolve these issues by registering them and sending someone at my office which did not happen .
 V gud service fast n perfect service I pike that . N one more thing ur executive rajesh was verry caring person he always think as costemer favor . Over all gud service keep up the gud work
 The store associate and staff was friendly and efficient Moreover I feel Vodafone provides good service and support
 The attendant was very very ignorant . Did not answer to all queries . When we asked him about why one of the plans was not activated he just said " if it
 I get good service from trissur Vodafone office.good co operation tooo .
 Yes i am fully happy to service .
 Two months back unnecessary put the 49rs charge I give compliant till date not revarsal . And last month bill also I can't open the mail I d .
 He talked to me nicely & explained to my doubts & tried to solve my problem As Fast.. .
 Respect customer approach
 Due to there irresponsibility and negligiblance i lost my money and time. . they don't know how to speak with customer.. . they raise there voice if I ask
 Understand
 All expereince waa gud , just add roam like home service to my number. . as ma residence cums in panvel nd ur nwtwrk is roaming here
 Very prompt and courteous service .
 There is no Transparency in your Billing system of 3G Data usage . I am certainly thinking of moving to alternate service provider .
 The ur representive explained all the plans in details with benifits which made us easier to selrct the plan as per my requirments .
 Vodafone understand pain of the customer
 Store associates are very helpful very cooprative and having good knowledge to resolve the matters
 Till date my query is not solved .
 I got satisfied with your service,and associate resolved my query .
 ion on Saturday . And behave of this person both of time very rude .
 When I was interacting with associate I got only that we can't do anything please talk to another and another was saying pleaese forgive I am busy
 My issue is not solved .
 Proper deal by your associate and solve all my problems while using your services
 Danish iqbal is very polite,friendly and helpful boy .
 Lack of info at store
 Overall the experience was ok
 I wanted a change of address and change of tariff plans to be done . No solutions provided
 All staff s vry nice .
 Very Good
 Nothing to text ... . Just waiting for 4 months to port my network
 Vodafone store and ur working members are great . But the waiting time for ur token to be announced is horrible .
 Don't do a fake promises to the one of your loyal customer
 Poor customer understanding & helping exp
 Problem solved after three attempt...I had to move counter to counter till 1.5 hr.. .
 Executive gave me complete information about my queries
 It took around 45 minutes to get a attendant
 I am fully satisfied Vodafone store visit but I am not satisfied Vodafone customer care
 Services is good
 We just came for a medical trip and was badly in need of a SIM card to keep in touch with home people and office . Sunday was a pain as almost all the places were closed and dealer shops didn't sell Nano sims and operators like DoCoMo had to take 2-3 days to activate . Finally we managed to drop Vodafone where the staff were really helpful and took the initiatives . It got activated within hours . We got a good prepaid pack with voice and data .
 Need seperate counter for payments and sim upgrading should be done in single counter .
 good to see
 Ms Jyotsna was very informative and helpful . Only the staff may be increased a bit to accommodate large number of customers .
 Very gud service
 5 stars
 Very quick and very helpful as a team
 No comments there is no value of my comments so THANKYOU VERY MUCH
 Thanks
 etworks also
 All the staff were uncooperative.. . Mr. Sachin was highly uncooperative..... . They fighter with us n instead of solving the problem they ask me to go toconsumer court . They bested one of my staff..... .
 mplaint action was taken and amont credited back ...hence satisfied.3.Store associates not customer friendly .
 GOOD TO SEE
 Ya it's verry cool in ur store
 Everything was quiet good . Need more manpower .
 Plz convert my postpaid to prepaid sim fast as soon as possible.. .

 Understand the requirement of client what exactly he wants to tell you and then only tell your tarrifs
 I requested for a 899 plan but your organization is forcing me to take 1599 plan . How can you force customer for taking services which he doesnot want??? ? Please provide me 899 plan or give me in writing that you cannot give it and let's meet in consumer court .
 From entry to exit warm and quick
 Reduce tariffs
 All the staffs are polite in behaviour and they easily solved my all the problem .
 Waiting time is too much There should be more counters working . There were around 7 counters but only 3 were there for customers
 Good service
 old me within 4 hours my problem will get resolved but till this time nothing has happened
 I want to stay in Vodafone but they couldn't understand to me any plan so I would dissatisfied... .
 I entered on 11:58 am, it took 1:30 pm . Two counters was not on . Request at coupon counter some executive should attend the customer . Lack of informationleads more waiting period .
 Let's see Dipak
 Totally your worst service, and I went to your care, they also given negative response . I never seen unreliable conversation with your exe at tumkur, Karnataka Vodafone store Token no 94 Date 29.12.2014 I never before seen this type service

 Quality of service and gentle approach
 Due to your good service
 Not customer friendly, not giving proper information, unwillingness for service, HAPPY TO SALE NEW CONNECTION ONLY.
 Takes quite a while in queue . Can u hasten it up a bit ? For that u will hv to find solutions yourself .
 It was quick turnaround by executives to help me .
 Hpy in every respect .
 Excellet hassle free service
 All I askd for was that the monthly statement be sent to me, as u hv bn doing uninterruptedly for the past 10 years . I got a heap of irrelevant replies
 Very Well

 Absolutely dissatisfied
 The staff was very co-operative . They taken only 10 minutes to solve my problem .
 The service of Vodafone is amazing .
 because location of vodafone store sakchi is very far from our house and the intraction of your is confusing and not satisfactory .
 Sijo is a pleasing character
 Mr Sijo is an excellent man
 Staff talk politely and take no time . Good

 Totally vkvas/ demaged
 AMEZGING
 The executive (mr.john) had a good ability to think like customer & act .
 e issue still exists . I am not satisfied at all . If coverage problem is not sorted I need to take an action against you .
 Good service . ..keep it up. .
 I was assisted in getting a nano sim asap and the associate was very courteous . Keep it up .
 excellent Vodafone store service
 In the postpaid connection company not give info about remaining minuts,messages and all other type of benifits
 Totally disapointing , Service, No Proper Feedback to custmor
 Store associate was very helpful and amicable .
 Services is good
 Good receiving and positive reply .
 if required . I was made to shuttle from one store to another because first one did not have cash taking facility . This is ridiculous .
 Staff was quite amiable and treated me with respect being a senior citizen . My problem was solved by knowledgable technician . Thanks
 Cooperative staff, detailed briefing, gud maintenance of store
 No body ready to help in the store They just send from one employee to another one same like gov . Office I m real surprise to see that Vodafone is doing
 Good & fast service .
 Good experience at store
 For the last four months I went to your store no.of times&chated with your staff online also,they are not respond and
 THERE SHOULD BE MORE SUCH STORES.WITH MORE TRAINED STAFF. _XX< MAY BE BIGGER STORES WITH MORE STAFF & COMPUTERS WORKING (24 * 7) _XX>
 er while he was serving me someone else rocked up and your staff starts serving him and left me on counter . Is that you guys call a ******* service ???And also my internet is not working from last five days . I want to know why should I pay the bill if I am not getting the service . I know your companyis on international level but what you are providing it doesn't match any standard as it should be . And I am not happy . Thanks

 Poor experience with Vodafone so costly plans for Internet
 Good service

 Q3 of 4: Ans-is 10
 Good
 Customer is not treatment is not good in the stores by your employees
 Am visited kunnamkulam store nd they provide what i need..and the executive solved my issue .
 Very nice service
 Please understand customers requirement giv right support .
 Try to reduce the waiting period for meeting the assistant.. .
 Well I was fully satisfied with all service n very polite staff at gallery...very good experience
 The company person is so irresponsible and nobody is to help out and the Vodafone always make fool of customers and their employees also do the same verybad experience and never ever wanna go with Vodafone in future b'coz I port my no . With another company
 s are not.. .
 Very excellent
 The person on desk smart & attentive enough to understand our quaries which is very imp according to me & then solve our prob promptly
 First receive the customer properly, next start your business . Each and every customer is valuable . Customers don't want pug dog follow up, they want onl
 No time to waste . I was directed to the right person as I entered . My request was attended immediately without taking much time .
 the relationship is not good . and the staff response is very bad .
 The ratings provided by me are very good and not outstanding due to the fact that this was the first Vodafone store after visiting many a Vodafone/Hutchstores in the last decade that lacked sufficient benches & chairs for customers . This shortcoming, however, was reduced courtesy of customer executive Mr Abhishek efficiently dealing with each and every customer including myself . He did this in a cool and composed manner without an irritated look .
 1)I lost my sim . . .i hav ben goin to . . Store frm past 10-15 days for my new sim .

 Nice.wel nd gud
 First i have to go store many time for activate my num.2nd my security balance dint come in m acc when i say to send my check they says that sir i have sent mail your security balance will come in just few days .
 Vodafone is slowly becoming like a government organization, with zero emphasis on customer satisfaction .
 I need red plan 899 and vodafone people are forcing me to take red plan 1299. I dont appreciate this !
 Untrained staff and no ownership
 I don't want to use diz plan. . It cost me very costly. . I want to change plan 149 to 199 rs. . But u didn't change. . Dat's y i vl hv to port out my no... .
 Your automatic token calling never works. . It ruins the whole system and when done manually creates chaos. . Please see into it
 Your service is very vell . But i have pay 100 rupees in your store but no recharge . Why ?
 ibit at store certainly puts Vodafone above other operators . Keep it up .
 I called him in the morning as my net was not working.he said your net will b activated in 4 hours.but still my net is not working and I called him 3 4 timesto tell him my problem but he didn't respond to my callI called him in the morning as my net was not working.he said your net will b activated in 4 hours.but still my net is not working and I called him 3 4 t
 I wanted a name transfer from my mother's to my father's . The informations that I got were all incomplete and had to visit the store 3 to 4 times and st
 Your executives were unable to give convincing replies while the manager couldn't deliver his promise . I'm highly disappointed overall with your services& decided to stop using them henceforth .
 It is rather appreciated if call is made from your end between 10 and 4 pm
 Main reason for my ratings is just one that i go with need of a micro sim card at vodafone store and i get it so quickly without any truble and its activated within just an hour of time .
 Matured Knowledge of customer grievances helps
 Useless service , horrible n undedicated staff approach in gallery . My query unsolved even after 3 months . ******* slow you ppl are .
 I did not get a receipt for the SIM I purchased
 Average
 Very good
 1. Several attempts to get my name and address updated have failed . Incorrect reasons have been mentioned in vodafone portal for this failure .
 ?
 I had a specific problem . The Vodafone staff had no solution . The rest - politeness, air-conditioning, courtesy etc . is of no use . On calling, I was directed to the Vodafone centre, from there to an email address . And finally, do you really think it is great customer service if you send an SMS to a customer at ten past two in the morning ?
 Please improve the qwality of the executives on 111 service and request the concerned authority to monitor their replies I have a couple of names deepakand devidas. .
 PL check my purpose of visiting the store, SLA and status of those two request . You would agree with me .
 On 18 dec i pd for 3 gb internet package still i havnt got anything .i visited your galary 4 times and still nothing has happend .now i am not interested in it so pl . Refund my amt .
 Billing complaint was raised in september but no action was taken for past 3 months . No response over toll free number . I was charged more money . So finally i need to visit gallery for resolution . Hope issue gets resolved this time .
 And quick
 0 he is nt interested 3 daes for sim x to b started
 Gud service
 Vodafone service is useless They call 100 times for new connection They call 100 times if we r disconnecting But for services they are not responding Useless Backend office
 To be more precise he acted with a careless way of answering We don't go to vodafone store for a big favour but to know and gather knowledge as I havetaken 3 more new connections . The moment I knew he wasn't interested and having patienceI left the place It may be because of his work pressure and he
 Main problem is network issue for incoming n outgoing calls where calls get disconnected n failed after every 5-10mts..kindly look into this plz !!
 Good Service for deepmala
 The branch at chembur Naka is overcrowded....it feels as if they purposely do so . The only plus point is once we are attended to, the problem is satisfactorily solved . But the crowd at the centre is a big minus point ....that has prevented me from suggesting Vodafone to others . I too am sticking to Vodafone only because other networks (read Airtel) haven't got good coverage in tilak Nagar chembur .
 Billing machine is not working properly at vile parle east . Not showing full payment as it shows less amount . If you are making payment then other guy s
 Non coordination of staff . Incapable staff to explain me the solutions for my queries .
 my net connection is not working since last 12 days
 My number got blocked as I did not use my sim for last 2 months . I wanted to re activate but they have given as postpaid . And said pre pAid will not be possible .
 I thought it may take time for my service but after visiting to Vodafone store I came it was few minutes to solve my problem.. . They made easy and soon
 Over all it was the Gud experience at the vodafone store
 They have activated the 3G 1 GB plan now
 10 farooq
 Unnecessary simply my balance is getting deducted eveday, Rs.99 Rs.49 n Rs 20.. plz luk into the matter
 I activated a new internet plan on the last day of my cycle . The cost of that plan was added to the bill for that month
 Better to call me
 Pooja bathija was someone who helped me and without any hassles the work was done, she even initiated that i come to know my work was done by initiating sms
 Vodafone service is not good . Very bad service. . really I m disappointed ur service . This is only for customer relationship officers .
 Need to speak to someone responsible on phone,send no

 GNG WEL CARRY ON............! !
 Good
 Good experience so far
 That was having a new experience which can a executive has treat us like their family member.. . The brand value is kept strong by the sweet executives
 Very good service by store employees
 I have got four connections of VADAFONE.That sums up my appreciation level.One or two nagging irritation is there, hopefully it will be looked into soon .
 The executive was gud and the experience was amazing
 I have an issue with my sim when used with my vodafone dongle for internet . As advised by customer care I went to store and I was asked to bring my laptop to check the dongle as they don't have a laptop . I have to spare another half day leave from my job for the same job . This was so irritating as custome
 It was clearly told to us that the new connections will be activated in a maximum time of 2 hours . But that didn't happen even after 5-6 hours
 Had approached for data plan migration as 3G coverage has been pathetic . Will comment further post plan change effective January 2015
 Your staff was honest enough to admit that in my bill for December i had been overcharged by rs . 200
 All I can say that I am satisfied so far.. .
 Really It Awsome Service
 It was pleasant to see that VF rep promptly recd not only to me but others also n I find all were happy with service
 Its a good experience always to visit Vodafone store as problem is always solved over there .
 customer friendly & quick response, however the same can b improved
 I have given satisfaction rating as follows: Q1-5/10 Q2-5/10 Q3-7/10 Q4-7/10 Based on issues resolved and the cordiality, patience shown by your official
 I was out of the store in 10 mins flat!! !
 I went to get new nano SIM for my new iPhone 5s along with my original passport . I didn't get Sim and the reasons were not valid . Please check Ithaca theteam . I am going to consumer court .
 Very good experience .
 for one simcard i visit gallary 6 time
 Long waiting, too much time spent on filling application & detailed leaflets are not available for VAS
 The executive Santosh Masurkar from Borivali West strore provided wrong information and told me to recharge the number which was of wrong amount . Steffithe floor manager confirmed this incident and apologised for this . Dont you train your people well enough to resolve customer queries? ?
 Language barrier
 Call rates become high and local and std packs are not that much satisfied .
 My overall exp was good
 Got . A. Great . Service . From . Gfs . Kunnamkulam . Thanks . A. Lot . The . Executive . Who . Gave . Me. A. Good . Service . Thanks . Vodafone
 Yr representative was polite, courteous and helpful...pls keepup the good work
 Good
 Verygood
 She has good attitude Or know very well how to attend the customer
 People spend time and come to the store and are asked to wait for too long . Post which you tell us that you cannot solve issues at the store and want meto call the helpline . This really ***** . The attention giving while selling a product is so great I have 2 executives talking to me but When I have a complain the manager takes his/her own sweet time to come and talk .
 Very good
 All my questions were answered solution given immediately very polite and courteous staff
 Call rate should be lower other than others
 very helpful
 Despite the self pay-kiosk being closed, there was a dedicated staff to collect payments .
 Certain hi end systems r giving very negative impact @ brand . Otherwise its ok .
 I want 3G activation on my number.But cusymmer care not help me.so I am very dissappointed .
 Understood my requirements immediately and offered solution to suit my needs which was efficient .
 I want to change to Vodafone Red 899 plan but have been told that am eligible for 1299 plan only by your marketing team . Since such kind of restrictionsare being put I have put my request for MNP and will be shifting to Airtel . Thanks for the services provided .
 Everthing was well organised n representative were also cooperative . ..but time given to each customer was less as other cus were in queue... .
 Bad customer service
 There is no clear information customer care says something different and store assistants says something else . Please tell is any service is necessary to accept if you want to solve your problems .
 Services are very satisfied and the store associate was very cooperative and polite and our requests were easily processed within a short period of time .
 Because there are very sincier staff they very kind heart
 Very dissatisfied
 Since I wanted the nano SIM card ...your store provided the card with warm reception .. .
 My experience about my dissatisfaction well beyond writing . It is requested you can send your executive to my residence . Pl.inform by sms .

 Excellent
 Overall service was nice the only drawback was the late attending .
 Excellent service

 Irresponsibility, whatever may be unlike your service

 Fantastic and knowledgeable approach towards customer.. . I was taking token vse came to me and ask how can I help to sir ..Luke the service.. . Store mana
 The person was willing to listen and understand the issue . Even though the issue resolution is pending assurance was provided . Too bad the phone helplineis terrible .
 Everything Was Just Perfect. . I Did Not Face Any Problems. .
 I am heppy
 simple..i am satisfied. .
 Priya was quick in understanding & resolving my issues . She came across as a pleasant person ready to help me . These words may be short to describe her excellent customer service but if u value ur customer's feedback then please have her rewarded because I think she is an asset to you organisation .

 Good service .
 Your's company very cheap & Cheater and vodafone store' member very rude
 good servese
 A little more seating arrangement for the ones standing in the que at the vodafone store
 My issue is still not solved . The problem with signalling still exists even after replacing with new sim . Many times, signals will go completely down to zero

 new *Sim
 he is very ambiguous .
 The representative needs training...as she was not aware of wat needs to be done....had lack of process knowledge n was not confident....dint give good customer service
 Good service
 Only 2 associates were available in store and there were many customers avaailable in store . This has caused some delay in attending customers .
 When ever I visit the store one time promblem resolve that was the main point thank you very much specially lajpat store
 I am sending sms,repetadly talking with 198,but Vodafone is protecting misselling at your mini store . Instade of solving my problem ,you people are harrasing me . I hope now Rs 99/ which is fradulently charged at your mini store will be refunded in my accont . Expecting positive call from competent authority . Dr Ashok Kulkarni
 totaly very good explane for plan,s your employe
 Pay your Store Associates more; recover cost from consumers and store experience scores will improve .
 They were very helpful and has given d exact info. . nd were very polite .
 The service was good, less wait time . Properly managed process .
 Prompt response, hand to hand resolution of compliant .
 See first no response from your centre for calls from us . second in one of our postpaid bill we had ISD charge without making ISD calls
 The rating is based on my interaction and efficiency demonstrated at each stage . Overall , a satisfying experience with committed staff .
 Issue yet to get resolved .
 The store for a change was relatively less occupied..person who attended was knowledgable and courteous . I got freed in 15mns
 Shri Suresh Gaud was very friendly . He could answer all our queries . Shri Nitin Chhodankar was extremely courteous and sent email for our penalty amount .
 Good service
 Helpful and cooperative and less time in processing
 Were very polite.answered my queries promptly.but took some time to get the information from co-workersas the personal had least knowledge about my queries .
 Very intractive and helping nature .
 The executive was very helpful . She provided all info in detail happily without any hesitation
 You need to work on store environment .
 Very good experience , porting done by Airtel is slow and very dissatisfying took 4 days Vodafone took 15 mins . Good service, appreciated
 nue dealing with all your customers this way, it's just matter of time to improve your perceived image in everybody's mind... . All the Best .
 1 NO PROVISIONS OF CALLING BY NO . NO COMPUTERING SSYSYEM TO CALL BY NO. LESS MANPOWER
 They are good looking and well dressed and behavior very good talk sensible and allways very good cooperative with me
 Well informed, professional service . Customer friendly atmosphere . ....problem solving approach .
 Nice and helping nature
 Problems don't get solved instantly at the store . The people there simply blame Vodafone corporate and say it will take time .
 Just a simple sim replacement took more than an hour...no enthusiasm in staff to close a customer and move to another...attitude of almost everyone in the storebwas very laidback.. . my number is more than 10 years old... . the network is fine... . but service is pathetic.. .
 100% satisfaction
 Product Knowledge Has to increase
 I m migrate from Airtel & promised for same Credit limit . But gave only 2000 which is 9time less than what I get in airtel . Also unnecessary follow-up for payment which really irritate . Person whom I interact have less knowledge . Don't feel me sorry to choose Vodafone . Thanks Sandesh GEUDER ASIA PACIFIC
 Vodafone cheating customers . Asking change in plan for last 2 months but stll not done . Call centre is sending to store n store just giving the new request nos
 Ur executive named manish was outstngd
 Teach them how to talk and to be decent . Hire new people throw out the male staff from ansal palam vihar
 Satisfing
 My problem was solved in such less time n such good service they provided
 ding was by and large good, there is always an uncertainty about the outcome after 72 hours .
 Store associate had absolutely no idea of what postpaid plans, Vodafone offers . Another store associate had to intervene since the former had no knowledge . The latter was extremely disrespectful in the way he spoke . Pathetic experience !
 Service are good and fast .
 Associate named karun was very rude and not cooperative at all.. . He was very arrogant .
 Staff were very talkative & noise
 Excellent quick courteous service . Special care to senior citizens . Keep it up .
 Nthng thanx
 Satisfaction
 The service at the shop was fabulous hence the rating . But the service post that has been abysmal
 Quick response and assistance
 The agent was good and despise was fast
 They don't have clearity in their own work
 Dear Sirs, I am quite happy about the service much much better than aircel customer centre but the executives morale is a bit low & looking at other execyou forward  with regards  A Balachander
 My problem was solved easily
 1.I was alloted counter A. Nowhere counter A was marked . 2. The person at the counter did not know all info . He called other person .
 On28 th . Very
 Good
 I have always had a great experience with Vodafone just wanted to give a small suggestion if you could introduce 4G
 I am not satisfied i want talk talk any had regards my prob otherwise i go for consumers court
 My query is yet to resolved
 Very gud
 Everything was smooth as expected . Nothing extraordinary in a good or bad way
 Please open more stores in the city
 prompt attention . immediate closure .
 The persons are not trained enough and they just want to skip off the issues
 Overall servic was gd bt can b more fast n better
 The reason is :- I visited the store & requested the executive to do something as Internet is not activated in my hand set & I am paying for Internet . BuShe forwarded the the request for refund, the request was accepted &I got the refund . I was operated for Bye-Pass surgery on 6th . Oct 14, so could't visit the store earlier . If can help me ,I will be thankful . Thanking you again .
 , the only down side was the waiting time in the q.
 There is querry solution, customer respective .
 Every thing was fine but there's is scope for improvement in dealing with customers
 I am very satisfied with vodafone connection . Becouse they have faster internet and anywhere network supply system . I recomend to all my friend and famil
 not ask for . I will write about my experience when I get back to England
 Willingness to understand the problem explain the situation try to provide solution
 ts cash . He bought 2 bills only . Last month my cell was down for 7 days because of ur problem but they charged full rent .
 Wanted a micro sim for my new mobile..got a good experience after visiting the vodafone store . Quick service and i got my doubts cleared..keep it up .
 Your representative r very cooprative .
 The team was courteous to respond to the queries and explain the best solution in the situation .
 y disappointed by vodafone, I am sincerely considering MNP.
 No one men is parfact the world... !
 PLAN. I AM FOR PREPAID FOR EVER. THANKS.
 Informed Polite Attentive staff
 Store associates should be more kind and open while talking to the customers
 Its good...we don't have to Waite longer for our turn.response is appreciated . Keep it up.good job.. .
 Yes very nice vodafon company
 Overall its good.... .
 Do not appreciate being dragged to a vodafone store thrice in a row owing to services being discontinued by vodafne itself . The marketing strategy for trying to get more customers for a postpaid connection stinks like the brits
 The only reason I give you'll a low rating is because your data connection is of very poor quality . The only days when it's up to mark is on Saturdays inthe morning . Otherwise it is not at all good or just reasonable .
 I m satisfied just because of excellent service in so much less time . Thankyou so much . . . Very good service
 Store associate had given all answer of my quarries with very politly and very cordially deposit my payment and given to me reciept
 :-)
 their way of interaction and attitude towards the customer is too rude. . it is like. . want it take it or door is this way...!! !
 Sir After 1 week i got my sim service on. . Mera no. . 1 hafte lag gaya on karane m Waha vasim karke koi the jisne paise liye the
 Prompt & efficient service

 Your plan is extremely expensive . I am being charged for incoming phone calls, which is ridiculous
 Exellent service n satisfected answer at ur store
 Pathetic service at the Vodafone store . They made me run 3 times just to get a nano sim.. .

 Very well done your service and best luck for Vodafone store

 de behaviour towards customer very bad experience i had ever in my telecom life .
 Waiting time should be less

 Always get well beheviar with good service .
 Vodafone store and executives are horrible experience . Opposite to company's slogan . Kindly check physically . For more call me .
 The executive gave a best service i was amazed and i got a wow experience good going maintain the same
 Value your old & faithful customers. . Disconnecting services for a just mere Rs 700 is not good when the customer is having a credit limit of Rs 10,000,been a customer for 4 years, have several other vodafone connections being used by the family and the customer was paying monthly rental just to keep thenumber active when was abroad for more than a ******* year.. . Do this one more time n this customer is off vodafone. .
 Query resolution was very good and also good product knowledge of team manager got appreciable response from team manager also
 No use
 I'm having network problem since last 6 months....there have been no progress inspite many complaints..please do the needful
 Service is good but make it fast .
 Verry good service
 so around 57 of us all vodafone users frm my bldg n d neighbouring 3 bldgs r planning to port out bcoz ull dnt care abt customers who r wid u since agesI have complained abt d network problem we r facing over a ywar n a half now none of d ppl have done anything n have infact given us d option to port out
 Store manager attend immediayely on my visit to the store since all customer support executives were already engaged and ensured my transaction was closed . Excellent team work
 Difficult to get thru ur cc
 I love Vodafone and their Services.. .
 Give best plans to Coustomer so dat they like more to use ur post paid service, dirvert them to post paid .
 My tariff changed without my consent.. . I wasn't informed about this change. . I need help to change my tariff
 It was a true customer care experience with the store being open on a Sunday along with very professional associates.Thanks
 The representative are very rude with customers . No manners to talk . Teach them some etiquette . Train them professionally .
 Token number do not run to every time . I have to wait at the vodacare .
 The representatives served me under some compulsion I believe not as passion To serve
 Good
 It was a very smooth process
 It's beautiful
 Very well organised set up and well groomed and helpfull staff !
 oove kar sakta hoon I'm very disappointed with your Vodafone store
 Depinding on my exp gave . My ratings . But there is always chance to improve
 Server was down n i was told to visit tomorrow again . You want me to take leave from my office n come again . I m not at all happy with the services provided in the store and in the helpline number . I will port my number .
 Good service
 Very good
 Worst experience.. . Sorry to mention. .
 The people sitting at the Vodafone office are not at all knowledgeable about all the services . They keep asking one another - bhai is Ka kya karna ? That gives customers a feeling of insecurity . Same thing had happened when I activated my Vodafone no for international calls before I went to USA in August . I had a very bad experience with these chaps . And the number did not work after reaching USA. I had given a complaint about this from USA and even after returning . But no one from Vodafone bothered to attend . Thank you for such good services
 Helpful n caring
 Good, helping and courteous staff .
 I can't digest the issues told by them as I think Such anti citizen rules should be discarded . So I can give a fifty percent ratings .
 Associate attendedy query quickly & calmly because most of the time associates are very rude and even they don't understand customers query ...... . Rajesh Kulkarni
 My ratings will help u to understand the loopholes in the services of vodafone nd helps to improve it. .
 Cust service was good But connectivity problem is very big in our area (mahavir enclave )
 Fast action
 Your customer care rating -10, for the small thing I would waiting since long after long waiting will visit your vodafone store to solve the problems andno one did the job .
 Only Vodafone
 Realy good service
 The officer attending me was focussed and well versed about Vodafone offers
 When I paid by cheque it was rejected without giving any specific reason . I had to visit your gallery only to request to return my cheque . This request could have been accepted over phone also which would have saved my time.money.efforts . in visiting your gallery . This happened twice in 3 months . This isnothing but disservice to customer .
 I am fully satisfied with your experience from your counter . Thank you
 Hassle free customer service with immediate attention
 Fast service very good... .
 It was good speaking to that person, queries were fulfilled,had a gud responce,satisfied! !
 Rakesh is good person nd fully help me very nic rakesh thx

Now after this I'm planning to buy n
 I have visited vodafone store twice for bill paymentsince i started using post paid plan,
 The executive attended was very helpful .
 The knowledge of ur staff and the way they communicate with customers us really good
 The officer of vodafone (ms prachi at south ext shop) was very cordial and provided solutions instantly to our quarries . Regards
 My problem not solved since long . It was sad that your customer care call center could not solve the problem and I had to take out time to go to the store . Very simple problem .
 mber . Finally I went for micro SIM and now I don't have any problem . Moreover, I got a call from Vodafone only once which I couldn't answer and it seemsSIM!
 Bcz m setisfy with their services
 Very very long waiting period even for a small query . Dread to go into your service store .
 Shifting from pre paid to postpaid is made easy and attractive but vice versa has wage rules. .
 They should help me out and shortout my query but instead of that they told me to convert my number into prepaid to postpaid .
 Very stisfying and helpful expetience .
 Associates are very attentive and active .
 u people r cheat and I m going 2 sue ur company for the same
 For an issue I had to go 3 times to the store
 The staff for non co-operative . They were not ready to understand the specific problem of the customer . They were not ready to apply their mind to find asolution . The executives involved were BHUSHAN, RAJESH and VINOD. Initially I was made to wait when all the executives were free and there was no customer at any of the desks .
 Good work .
 Don't give any proper guidance, moreover keep us waiting and keep on chatting with there colluges
 I was totally happy and satisfied with the service provided .... . Thanx
 Because of irresponsilbile behaviour of the staff at the store, I was harrased, not once but many times ! Whenever questioned directly they are just say sorry .
 Levy Joseph Thomas have already Replied Levy applied for TRIPPLE VODAFONE TEL.
 They explained very well about the postpaid plan and excellent
 Takes too Long to be attended ! With incompleteness of matter
 loy satisfied me and assured me to rectify the bill.His service is brillient .
 The store associate interacted with me very well . He listened to my query and resolved it in the best possible way .
 The RM patiently handled all the queries raised to full satisfaction .
 Best service provider
 Your cre was done great job for sitting your store
 Staff members are trained enough to interact with customer
 Priya is doing good service
 I was going to permanantly deactivate the my sim services bt ur executive explained about my rental plan detail properly and my other mob no bill also explained so i change my mind and to be use continue this services . Bt please dont be wrongly charge on my bill
 Service is better than before
 her one of thm I approached had an arrogant attitude . Finally I met Mr jagjit who listen n helped me out
 Your kiosk machine is not at all helpful as ppl use to avoid huge que n save time but this couldn't even recharge my phone and the store is helpless andask to wait for all two days . Please improve on this .
 I am very happy with services of vodafone store and rashmi behaviour . All members of store are very helpful and nice

 Very good services .
 Good interaction with representative.. .
 Service of Mr. VED SHRIVASTAV was very well . I hope company will promote him as soon as possible .
 Really superb
 ice and billing
 I am not getting the proper coverage in my city and the 3G fluctuates a lot ..
 Awaiting solution than we can give rating
 I asked for a new connection and due to some strike or something it took to days for a new connection . In the same call that I called to confirm my parti
 I made payments to my two cells through cheque and other payments through cash . Three times store goofed up the payments and proper posting had not beendone . Or produced the cheque late to bank . My phone was debarred . Pain I gone through to visit to stores to get payment details corrected , indifference and unconvincing response by stores on payments mistake and and reversal of delayed payment fine corrected only once . Your call center executives are pathetic .
 With me every thing was fine . But with another customer the staff was not cooperating .
 It was nice
 i had ported from airtel to vodafone expecting a good 3G speed at vodafone but now i want to port back to airtel but vodafone is not allowing me to do so .
 I was answed and was provided with my quarries
 Good experiance
 Good atmosphere Qualified professionals Immediate response
 Amazing
 Our office booster in the office has not been working for over one month hence there is no connecitivy with our clients or field staff . To our emails noresponse relationship manager is helpless visit to your elicits reply matter will be resolved within three days nothing happens our mouth is shut pacified for time being how long ? Nobody tells what is wrong . Reminds me of mtnl days mera telephone nahi lagta
 Store associates' response to enquiries are very poor . Their customer service is very bad . They are least bothered even if a customer wants to go to another service provider . Absolutely zero efforts towards Customer retention . They badly need to watch the kind of language that they use in front of customers . Very disappointed to know that the brand that I am a customer of for the last 10 years has such pathetic Customer service associates in their stores .
 There are network problems that needs to be improved
 I feel very glad to being Vodafone customer . Its very useful for everyone .
 My Question was very simple .. Why my balance being Deducted as DNLD D2C NDTV.. When I don't use any NDTV app or any content of NDTV. No one can give meanswer for that not even your so called "Nodal officer" . Still this question is mystery for me .
 in the vodafone store started.i told her 3times my outstanding is due she cares dam about it my issue is still pending
 I interacted with Nasreen . ...she patiently answered all my questions . ..resolved all my issues . ...I thank her for all her support . ..hence high score
 It topk 70 minuts to get my turn . Why should i spend so much time ?
 My work was done quick
 Your service associate was probably not willing to perform or may be tired at that particular time .
 Ur asociates are so rude dats it....so plz growup guys
 Ratings cannot be good unless the matter is quickly resolved in this era of computers
 I never visited your store recent months and neither i requested the deactivation of data pack .
 Kindly help me to track my I phone with the help of my Imei number it was stolen from my shop
 Because for what I went there was resolved in just 30. The executive was well spoken . So simply it's better, smarter, faster .
 The experience with vodafone is better than any other networks used till now .
 Customer care executive named Shammin Khan was extremely rude and unhelpful to interact with . He activated the wrong service on my Vodafone number, 12508GB internet plan instead of the 1299 Red Plan .
 00460061006E00740061007300740069006300200065007800700065007200690065006E00630065002C0020006500780065006300750074006900760065002000770061007300200071007500690074006500200073007500700070006F00720074006900760065002E002E0020263A

 I have thrice visited your store for change of my mobile number from company name to my individual name as i have left the organisation . Twice i have submitted all documents including NOC from company and cleared any overdues also but still i am waiting for positive results .
 Systematic token system even during rush hour . Well informed staff communicate well with customers and make valid and useful suggestions .
 You treat coustmer as he is asking for charity
 Feeling Vry Nice Nd Special
 It takes two and half hour to speak to yr executive
 Well vodafone is is a good company and its network is also best but still its too costly there are also no plans about talktime.you need to cut the rates
 This store environment was like fish market.If u want more details do call me
 Good service
 I don't know come back in couple of days .
 No one is ready to help .

 I visited your store at 10 am . There was only 1 client in the store, yet it took 15 minutes to meet the staff . I had gone to change my sim to micro sim.m was activated at 8.30pm .
 Very helpful girl awesome customer service Always smile and welcome customer Ready to help Full product knowledge
 Awesome seervice provide by cce and very coprative nature
 Service and product knowledge are better
 My difficulties have been solved and she has explained me nicely .
 He was soft spoken, and dedicated............ . Thank you!! !
 I dont think my consumer feedback will help in anyway . Better you appoint me as a consultant so that your company can revolutionize itself rather than casually working on consumer satisfaction
 The unprofessional and rude behaviour of Mr sujoy ghosh and Mr dipjoy chatterjee from saltalke Vodafone store near City center could be counted as the reasons .
 No body is responsible about coustomer problem . They works like govt . job .
 Good
 So far,the store experience was good . But the services could be better .
 Difficult to write but it took some 2.5 hrs to get the work done . Associates are not polite and educated on processes . One associate shahbaz was extremeunprofessional and sad . Only asdociate good was parul .
 Vodafone cse very helpful person
 Vodafone advise to ignore the SMS recd from Vodafone system and I was unable to understand what is happened to such professional company I would like toapply for Airtel
 I am very happy in vodaphone
 Cooperation
 I purchased a vodafone dongle router for Rs 3000/ waited 8 hrs for activation - did not activate - went to store and they could not either - they said main vodafone server is down wait an additional 48 hrs - this is very inconvenient - I should have purchased the Tata photon device
 The associates were very helpful and timely. .
 I was accorded prompt service, the store associate listened to my queries patiently and came up with satisfactory answers . Very professional & efficient!! !
 Your rep. has understood my problem & resolved it .
 Store associate Mr. X.. . guide me very well
 Improve on speed
 Quick service and understanding
 First of all the numbers you assign should be clean, ie the customer should not get calls, which people make for the previous user, you would probably have to hold the number for 6-9 months before issuing again . Secondly all services like whatsap for example should be discontinued for the previous user.Thirdly, no calls should be made to a customer introducing services or enquiring anything, I have received such irritating calls continuously and even inthe afternoon Siesta time . Customer should be asked while issuing the cars if he wants to receive such calls, not told that seven days after he complains such calls will be discontinued . What is surprising is that with so much competition Vodadone is giving such service
 Very sarisfying service Peeragarhi branch, delhi Mr Sachin
 Fake Internet plan suggested by customer care executive ashalatha n rajashree(not sure about rajashree name, but name ends with shree ) . My other two numbers was 199 corporate plan n it was increased to 249 without intimating . This is really bad . I am thinking to move out from Vodafone all three Sim .
 Store staff is very good....and the employees of the staffs was very good very very good....and shahbaz is the excellent person of the staff.... .
 Nthng mch gt offrs lyk tlktym rechrge where local n std calls be in paise per min than doing separate recharge
 awsome comapny vodafone. .
 I wanted 899 Vodafone red but they offered me 1299 and above plan
 We had to wait as staff was less n the person attending was not v good in english
 Helped with with the best plan for me .
 Good Service... .
 The service provided was excellent and well satisfying.My issues were instatly solved .
 They guided me to select good 3 g internet options,
 Good service and understanding delievery .
 Very nice and satisfied customer service thank u
 The experience was very hassle free
 I was not satisfied very much but go to see my problem was saughted out .
 I was overall satisfied with the way I was attendedto
 Visited your store 2nd time in a week . Service request of one week before was still pending . Store executives told nothing in their hands . Things haveto be done from back end . Then why have you opened the stores . Things which were to be done in 48hours have not done in 192 hours .
 Very kind she told me how to use every pack and how to use here after no more doubt about vodafone bczs they r happy to help us we r happy to use ur network
 I thought this feedback was for the Vodafone store( physical Vodafone store in Allahabad.) l had too much bad experience there . That's why I gave 3/10 tothe first message . About the Tele-customer care, the service was quite good . Hence I gave 8 and 9 in the subsequent questions .
 d asking your representative for 3times
 .no solution.. . This is fraudulent act by you which I will not accept...this is the worst experience n Vodafone is not faithful at all I strongly believest...I have 5 more Vodafone numbers which I am surely gonna deactivate if I don't get proper solution.. . All I am getting is just complaint registered..I got a call from Vodafone about plans...I chose 499plan and 899plan got activated and now you say to pay the bill of 1000 which I will not pay at any co
 Very very nice and convenient happy to be a Vodafone customer
 Very patient staff
 You are fraud company. .
 Awesome exprnc.. .
 No Proper information provided to the customer . They make the customer to visit the store on vicious circle but the result is zero .
 My problem was well understood readily helped me .
 Hope my work will be done. .
 Very co-operative !
 Vodafone executive must have through knowledge of functions . I had interaction with unskilled executive, he didn't know how to deal with customers . Some
 Ratan is very good person in VODAFONE STORE your service is very good and i like Ratan service.. . Thank You

 Over all service was good... . but I had to wait for full half hour after taking token as no one was on der seat except cashier so I shout on them and after dat dey all came on seat and start attnding customer so I would suggest u to update ur stores with good n sufficent numbers of employes .
 Good service
 I am using Vodafone number from last 9 years
 Gd
 Never seen a service takes so long for international roaming. . almost 20+ compliants and 10+ requests went all for a toss and nothing happened that showshow ridiculous is the service .
 Excellent service my issues fully resolved very useful touch point
 Lack of proper & detailed knowledge about the documents required was given at the first visit thus 3 visits were made to do the work .
 Overall it was very good experience.. . I am very pleased with your executive.. .
 Super overall
 I got very good resolution Nice to visit
 I have a corporate connection . To change my traiff they say you have to send mail . Not to visit branch . But it was done in other branch . How come it changes from branch to branch . Jk
 The person who served us Dinesh was efficient and quick and helpful . But there was chaos in the store . People coming in were not directed to take token.The person at the cash slow . And a lady in one of the counters was giggling and wasting time and in our 25 minutes at the store had not managed to serveanyone .
 Super service good produck postpaid knowledge . ... .
 Overall I am happy with Vodafone
 thinking to convert into prepaid keep the Sim for only incoming unnecessary I am paying heavy rent with services for no service
 The store people are helpless and are not understanding the client problems rather getting aggressive at the clients .
 1. Your call center provided incorrect info on docs needed . 2. My address change despite provision of all docs didn't happen . 3. It required 2nd visit toyour shop . Absolutely time wasted
 The guy in the counter was not aware of what I was asking for and the experience was dry .
 Solid
 NA
 Bec I like Vodafone services
 Feel good . Thanks .
 Nice ***
 Vodafone is great
 The response is very fast and i always get my work done
 Actly on my first reply i should have written 8 only, by mistake i write 8 to 5; i can't give full marks because service of your is not the best as thereis lots of problems for us like waiting for our turn after taking token, sometimes your token machine does not work properly n sometimes your executivesdo not present in their respective seats; these are one problem and one other thing that i didn't like is that, most of your executives behave wel but afew of them might be lagging in terms of behaviour, they need to groom themself a bit more. .
 Good experience overall... .
 store associate was helpful and friendly too . And helped me in choosing my right tariff plan . THaNK you
 3 5 4 they told me i will get internet connection within 4hrs but i did not get it so far
 Extended expired time for card .

 Your call centre as well as store unable to resolve my query, and also unable to solve my problems . Is this your service ?

 Very gud service of vodafone
 Thanks for your support
 Very fast and quality service than airtel .
 I am quite satisfied & happy .
 Super responce
 Great
 getting SIM changed to micro SIM was impossible with amount of details asked . I finished this in 30 secs at a local shop .
 Absolute ignorance by staff
 I have recd text from Vodafone changing my 3G plans unilaterally . When I sent my Assistant to Bhandarkar Road shop and asked how plan is changed from 1GBto 300MB he was told I never had 1GB plan . I have bills to prove . Also was interested to increase 3G plan of 9822035110, my wife phone . My family has 5postpaid and 4 prepaid Vodafone . And still I get such treatment .
 token system ws nt applied properly it ws irritating as ur executives we're nt following d token series properly . Guy who resolved my prob ws helpfulothrwise experience ws quiet ok .
 to deal with customers ?
 I didn't get my 3G connection as promised
 Rajesh has given excellent service. .
 Store associate Nalini was very polite and helpful but solution of my problem is not resolved yet...Immediate solution is missing with vodafone..Please improve your service and network
 The overall store was good ...though the staff was not full in numbers ....may be because Sunday . The service was quick but communication was weak .
 The person was very rude did not know how to talk to customers
 Firstly, security personnel behavior was very rude . Secondary, your staff could not identify why I have severe network connectivity problems . Third, the
 Executive priya's support is excellent. .
 Keep up the good work
 Over all experience is bad on token sequence to the way the reps attend
 very good experience nice behavier . help & support
 Behavior of the staff is not good . Specially floor supervisor miss neetu.
 Very good & Quick service
 nice
 Fast action immediate rersults
 Eccellent customer care and expecting to continue with the same .
 Very good & quick service
 Customer is valued at the centre .
 Exelent
 Staff was very knowledgeable, courteous & understood my issue clearly .
 Best network and best staff
 I already submitted my documents to change my plan to corporate plan, but u dont have any records on your system...awful experience. .
 I satisfy for my complain registered, but balance unnecessarily deducted from my account, I request you plz . Return me in my account .
 You people are cheat.. . Bad service.. . Bad store associates.. . Liars and cheats you are.. . Your associates say something and they do something
 sterday I really satisfied with the experience in HSR layout store....but I don't know why that Whitefield people cheated me
 I need a call back as I have a buisness plan but I am not able to call in your customer care . I am ****** and need help
 My internet 3G not working from past 3months & still got no solutions .
 Your store people helped in changing my address registered with vodafone successfully and confirmed the waiver offered earlier to me that i was unable to
 My query has been answered satisfactorily
 Thanks for the service today . I anticipate receiving similar service from other Vodafone stores located in the city
 It takes too much time to get your query sorted .
 Number of counters are more but only two were working .
 Sometime Vodafone Does not Reasponse my call and Some time they not corporate or help Suggests me at Vodafone Store but today I glad to service from Naraina they Solved my problems just a moments I liked it
 When I approached the Vodafone store to take a sim there was great courtesy and enthusiasm . Once I took it the enthusiasm of your staff to help me took af doing business I must say !
 My any problems of related Vodafone full salution in my main Vodafone store . And saurbh are very coperetive man .
 Since last 3 months followup doesnt provded the right service as committed would like to port to another service providor . Let me know the process of porting
 Your store people take a lot of time attending to customers .
 orry to say that I will switch over to air tel . I shall not pay any sum for this mobile Internet connection with Vodafone .
 Better service at Goregaon west
 Intelligent people with ability to understand the customer need quickly and extremely polite Thanks and keep it up .
 Because my 3G is working slowly
 VODAFONE SERVICE IS VERY GOOD SERVICE
 The officer was cooperative .
 3g don't work in new sim
 I m charged international sms every bill when I don't have ISD service . Ur stores always have a wait for more than 45 min . And ur rep pretty much can't danything except give us a complaint no . I hate Vodafone and wouldn't recommend it to anyone . Given an opportunity I would change it as first instance .
 It was good . But needs some improvement . Store associates need to be more patient while listening to a customer and his query . This aspect is good but can be further improved . Therefore my rating is 9.
 Personal attention
 The problem is not resolved properly .
 Its awsome
 We walked in and out of ur showroom in 10 mins . Your cashier Sushant or Shashank (not too sure of his name) was one of the most patient and helpful support staff I have encountered for any service related issue . Your manager Binal was super helpful as well . The whole experience left us pleased
 For the same thing I hav talked customer care several times n visited store three times but my prob . Is not solved yet .
 e thing . Such a shame
 Based upon my recent store visit, I would not like to recommend Vodafone to anyone because of the unsatisfactory services & Customrcare (111) department's services as the process is too lengthy .  Q2 of 4: I am very much satisfied with the SERVICE provided to me by your executive in your store .  Q3 of 4:I am very much satisfied with the interaction I have had with your Store Associate .
 Mr. Siddhart is very heplful person, his very comfort for my problume .
 Mr. IRSHAAD was very helpful and patient . He extended the best co operation towards my concern..I had a good experience . .
 Good precentation
 Exlent . . . .
 Thank you for your good service
 Good service
 Dont have much time . Sorry !
 Make your store spacious with good and modern infra in RohtasNagar/Shivajipark .
 Work neature is best
 he problem patiently and tried to resolve it within his limitation
 Very helpful and curtious people,
 Wow grt intrrctn
 we seriously arrange some donation to resolve it . "Open your mouth if you need but dont cheat your coustomer" .
 Unnecessary demand for previously verified documents of old existing customer !
 Very bad experience..i asked about some better plans and about change of plan..but he offered me to use another sim card for use of internet and told methat no solution for this...this is not the way to treat the customer..atleast u can suggest some better plans as per my need..but he asked me to port the number ''since nowadays its very easy'' he added .
 xperience was good
 Very well floor manage by team ..
 Till now nobody call to me yourside
 Store exp was good . I like vodafone . The reason I rated the staff 8 is as I asked him abt the red plan . As my bill were coming high . He straightaway toldme of the 899 plan . Thought he could have told me abt the 599 and 899 that way I could choose . I later went online and got to see what plans were available .
 Quick response, politeness of staff . Most important good professional behaviour
 Kept me waiting and moved from counter to counter for my token . One of his friend got inside the queue without token . Even after my request for changingmy number to prepaid, Saurabh kept selling me other postpaid plans...still did not got me what I requested . Bad service .
 Your staff are competent and friendly
 Poor service , stringent compliance for delayed payment, no poor network coverage within city limit and no 3G coverage in outside Corporation and rural areas and charges comparatively high and so many complaints .
 I like vf
 The service person who attended me does not know anything . And he can not able to understand my problems . And he not able to give valid answers .
 It was postpaid . By mistake is wrote prepaid
 No proper postpaid plan . Other Telecom have better plans
 Pathetic
 Reasons are pretty simple . It shows that you CARE since Customers Are Really Everything (CARE) .
 But now I'm gonna port with number to some other service provider . Very much disappointed from Vodafone .
 i already given u
 Good experience
 Not able to solve call forwarding problem
 Good
 Very promit and patiently
 Hi i am ur customer since 2006 when i went to the store i did not take a photo copy of my id the vodofone executive immediately helped me i asked his help to changemy old sim to the new one he himself changed pretty courtious person
 So that is pretty much the same question isn't it ? I mean I wasn't helped by your furniture but by a real person and I'll still give him a 10 (You do notallow higher than that but he was really helpful and kind) PS. Your very strange ringtone still bugs me to no end !
 Each customer must be given equal attention regarding their issue
 Very good
 Make it more easy and more understandable .
 Signals are very weak from Vodafone as compare to airtel...need to work on that.. .
 was so happy .
 Excellent service but would be better if the matter is dealt with by seniors and not by trainees
 To the point talk and quick work
 For exchange of similar card all documents need not be asked
 Servic is very good
 M very happy with yor services
 Visiting store multiple time for a single issue,Sim activation .
 Service is good and store associate was helpful and nice I am happy
 Yesterday the information shared by first executive was very bad, so due to this I wasted my time . Went again to stores.. . But today meet one executive named mohan lal very good in explaining the query and completed my work in ten min.. . Hand off to him .
 1. Your associate was least interested to resolve my issues . 2. He is a liar, asked me to make payment so that he could resolve, once payment was made, he retracted and asked me to write to customer care . 3. I escalated to his manager and he seemed most uninterested even to listen to me . 4. All this leaves me in bad taste of my experience with Vodafone and once this billing cycle is over, I will move all 3 numbers to Airtel who by far are superior by anymeans in terms of service and understand the true meaning of customer care
 Overol experience was great
 I have exchange my 2 sim in micro sim but your sales executive not exchange my other vodafone pripaid sim in micro sim
 The service is good at the store .
 U were almost good and prompt . Much better than call center experience
 Its best network and provides perfect pack for customers
 Pls send the internet setting
 Co operation, instant action & accurate feed back .
 I need to go 1 hour from my home...for my work to be done in vodafone main store though I have a mini store nearby !
 h no resolution . I am using your services since last 10 years but now I think I should switch to Airtel for better services and customer care .
 My heart touch your store staff omr vinoth
 Greattt
 Your employee of the store is very good .
 Your executive bhupendra is a honest emp of yor company .
 My problem was not solved .
 Waiting time is too long . Staff r efficient . There r too many offers available which makes it confusing . Offers need to be streamlined .
 They are uncertain about the bill charged to client . Mainly download chg charged in a bill Get exempt for one month after complaining . But no revert onearlier months wrongly charged . Its a corporate plan . And not the correct way to serve to your corporate client .
 Bahut time lagta he apna no aneme,yor repsentative work so slow,ap ke represtative 1 cstomer ke bad gayab fir aake 2 cstomer fir gayab..chair ese hi khali. . Or hamara time yuhi khrab hota he. . 30 to 50 mnt wait karo tb no . Aae. . Tht i dnt like. .
 No comments for rating . But since yesterday i am unable to make outgoing calls, even though my phone show full network . Please rectify it soon .
 Fulfill ol my quiers
 Excellent service
 Sim was lost . The store associate did her job fast..answer few f my questions with a smiling face..generally it was a quick pleasant and fast experience
 Vodafone service is vry nic .I really like it... .
 Not giving complete n fair understanding to customer regarding tarif plans transperancy is not there feel cheated by vodafone wil port if not respondedin time n go to media n TRAI
 Token was generated at 12.14 number was called at 12.52... . Tokens were not called in chronological order.. . It was observed that in some counters formswere being filled up by officers while customers were waiting in the queue.. . There was a gap of 20 minutes between 2 customers because the officer was busy filling up forms...,, overall service level is disastrous and to top it all the officer called Rajesh who ultimately called by token number told me that I was "unnecessary arguing" when I tried to place my complain to him .
 if i ask the reason of my increased monthly bill...insted of explaining the reason..i am being told to change the current billing plan..how can customersatisfy with such answer..also i m not sure of minimum bill in next month because of such unprofessional approach..thanks
 U locked my number without any info and after that the service provided by the associates were not upto mark they didn't know what actions can further betaken I was very much dishearted by the service and had suffered a huge loss due to the locking up of phone . Being an old postpaid customer I expect thecompany should understand what action it's taking . I expect that no further problems occur in the service
 Good prompt service .
 I had visited Vodafone gallery for sim exchange happy to know that it was not charged
 I am very happy with your Sarvics2 the best way for me
 I have to replace sim, that was done even after close of ur business hrs . After 7 pm
 Vodafone superb fantastic best network i really like vodafone
 The back office staff is total **** , they don't know their own systems and products . They commit something and it happens after a day with strenuous follow ups . To activate a number it takes a day , to start your internet takes another day . Total ****
 Better service than others
 I like the way staff gave all the relevant info in details .
 I have been a Vodafone customer for over 16 years and have several numbers in the family . Generally my visits to the gallery have been pleasant and my queries have been addressed to my satisfaction . So I have no reason to complain and do appreciate the good service .
 Executive not given reply and asked me to mail the query . I visit store in spite of my busy schdule .
 I'm spoke to your one of executive regarding the wifi data card but he didn't any information in this regards . After I went your vodafone store at Ansalplaza he also no idea about the same but wifi data card is hanging in front of your executives.i spare some time to buy the data card but I didn't because proper knowledge is not with any one.i had used my same no . from last 7 years but couldn't understand as off now . Regards, Aman saini
 I gone to ur store to get micro sim for new phone .. . It was horrible experience
 Ok

 Good
 appy overall .
 Their is no option for us to know our remaining free min and no messege is displayed when we cutdown our phone like call duration and minutes used that'swhy i rate 8 in second question
 The lady associate was very professional and efficient at her work . It took less than 10 minutes to get a nano sim for my phone .
 good
 Over all your experience was bad
 Ur executives were nt accepting payment on counter with credit card .
 My 3g net is not working...even after the complaint.. .
 Service is good, getting signal everywhere
 Services is good
 Yester dy i ws in vs bt i hd to wt fr one hr aftr tht thy tld me to cm on mndy wid xrox copies thy can say it at the begining..dn thr ws no one to attnd me .
 Good service from u and one thing I know to suggest u that some of ur employees are giving wrong comments with customers so please tell them don't do like this
 My problem is still not resolved :(
 No comment ji..only problams In my SIM number
 Long queue , no space for waiting, deadly slow system for updating data
 Plz kindly interact with people...n they r spending there precious time...so u also give ur time 2 them equally... .

 I experienced tremendous improvement in your services . Thank you :-)
 Ok managable
 The ratings could be higher if only your front office was better organised to inform customers that a token should be obtained . Your staff attended to customers more promptly . Finally proper sinages
 Bcoz my problem was solve
 The service delivery is fine but it irritatingly takes exceptionally long hours to wait for one's issue to be addressed by an representative. . Moreover,the token vending systems also seem to do no good since it never works properly . The environment is that of a government bank whew people are being called by names
 I disapointed with the call rates, and late proceed on request..best regards sumit ambhore
 Excellent handling by the Vodafone agent Very knowledgeable and helpful
 the customer . Arrogant answer for any question the customer asks...lot more
 Staff pit up for guidance are quite young and immature to understand and response with due care .
 Your store staff are workless
 Staff very good and co-operative n help full and my requirements were fullfilled as per needs
 Excellent service . As always
 Over all good .
 I hv been a very loyal customer but hv nvr got anything from vodafone
