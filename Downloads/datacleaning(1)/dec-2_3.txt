 I had to wait 1 hour to get a new nano sim which only takes a minute . There was a huge queue and your executives were sitting and gossiping while the crowd got agitated . They were rude and had no customer service skills whatsoever . One of your employees actually argued with a customer and was telling your cashier how he ' shut up the Bihari '. There was a ridiculous lack of professionalism and I will never visit that store again . I would suggest youyourself go in and see for yourself . Go in as a customer and not as an employee and see how they treat you !
 ff is very arrogant . They are not ready to listen to the customers problems only . I will port my no . asap . Vodafone gives bad services . Not recommended.saying that i hav to pay 2500/- and also there is a lot of network problem wid my no . for which the gallery people arent helping at all . And also the staFirstly, while converting from prepaid to postpaid i was told that i can start my conferenc call facility after 3 months, but now the gallery people are
 The lady who attended to me was very helpful and professional . I would recommend her for a higher post .
 It was worst experience with ur company I m keep complaint to ur nodal desk on my complain Byrd each level of ur officer is behaving irresponsible in still I n writing this feedback my complain is not resolve
 Internet network is not efficient in some areas like in my apartment at shahibaug maharshi apt .
 customer satisfaction company
 First tell me can you mitigate my problem . Now I am retiree,your Vodafone has sent me inflated bill for which great financial problem is being experienced . Can you do something for me otherwise I am not interested in giving you any answer . Can you help me . Please advise ways means .
 The person earlier from Sion gallery is very careless in handling client, the person from prabhadevi was very helpful in rectifying the wrong plans, andhas suggested appropriate plans that fit my usage, cud see the efforts taken during my visit to prabhadevi gallery,
 Got expected solution by associate..way to speak and explanation about issue and solution .
 I was made to wait for 1 hr . U need increase no . Of staff at malda outlet . Thanx .
 Good service keep continuing
 I waited for an hour and left . Thre were others who were waiting for 2 hrs.. .
 I am using VODAFONE SINCE 1997 HENCH I am fully CONVinced
 Because its christmas time..guys
 They helped me understand a better plan and how better I could benefit from the same . I may have lost my cool but they did not, extremely polite and professional .
 Please find a way to change the name for my number . ..
 They issued me a Nano sim for my new iPhone yesterday from RT nagar vodafone store but I believe it is still not processed as heard from customer care ,annoyed on that and I have to visit the store again
 Please give me best plan
 It better . To . You to . Give further and advance training to staff
 Very likely
 Service approach is missing, executives are busy in their own works other than attending customers.they are working as if they are doing favor to customers .
 I was trying to figure out my no . As I forgot... . When I approached them they didn't help.................. .
 0 for all ur questions... . u ppl should shut down d company
 Very quick service and giving proper knowledge of all offers.. .
 Wel it ws gd to c vodafone office nd ya dats it.. .
 I love Vodafone . Thanku Vodafone
 I didnt like waiting for my turn for hours
 Got an immediate solution
 me being harsh with my words and attitude he was calm enough to handle my case correctly. .
 Good job
 Because my vodafone connection is from the store and not from any agent but still im facing issues with my bill....pathetic
 Because the guy on the cash counter swiped my card for Rs 249 instead of 150 and I have still not received back the money .
 Yr Q 3 - I was disappointed . Even though yr staff was polite, due to lack of good Tech knowledge , it was of no use
 The person who gave the token number was promt and polite . I was attended well by mandlik (I am not sure of name) he then put me on to anurag who understood the problem . Saw the details in system and help me resolve my problem and sent mail to concern authorities for confirmation . Since I was convinced byanurag I made the bill payment and regularise my vodafone number
 Google services good
 The service attendant Satish was very courteous, attentive and patient with all my queries .
 His approach is very good !! he helped me out veryy quick !!
 The store did not appear to have any proper system in place They did not appear organised
 Very satisfied J.D .
 Its great service
 It was a satisfying experience . Thank you
 orts and headache .. . They found the exact reason and solution.. .
 Good service
 hing them all the best .

 U r store person approch not Satify further details condact me

 I think this feedback too waste of time
 Service experience 8
 ANITH AYOUB NO GOOD SERIVIC
 In all respect I received the best help during my visit to the shop which led me making such marking .
 Excellent service
 The rep first charged me for a micro Sim and the later when I asked a bill for the same, he recharged the amount to my account . What's going on here ?
 Customer care doesn't really care about customers complaint or needs . No follow ups from your end . Issue not fixed after 5-6 visits and calls to Customercare . Pathetic service . Pathetic follow through . Definitely never recommending Vodafone to new users and will be switching to airtel after this billingcycle .
 Excelent
 I have taken 1.30 hours to attend . I m not satisfied with the answer . he don't revars the bill . so I don't satisfied with the service . if I don't want the net so why company charge me about that . I will use this card since 2 years .this is my worst experience
 Vodafone store supab but time is money and you staff is loa on time
 Vodafone care executives are treating customers like shit... .
 Always have to wait for s very long time in the outlet . There is hardly any place to sit also .
 Delay in giving prepaid sim . No proper response to the customer .
 Time to respond to a call should be faster . People manning the show is excellent but there should be more technology Involved in customer relation .
 It was good
 We i cal to customer care they dont response and visit ur store they also . I asking for port issue they directly says go no problem .
 Very rude staff .
 The staff was very rude and didn't solve my query
 Keep it up
 The staff there r less informed and less experienced and are less in number then available counter .
 Did not get a first point resolution
 e to refund amount charged for net usage in bill dated 04Dec14 and reduce the amount charged for net usage at flat rate from 04Dec to 21Dec14.
 Your service ***** !! ! 2 days back I've visited your store in Whitefield to change my current post paid plan . The guy told me that it will be activated in 4 hours but now 2 days passed and nothing has happened. . U want bills on time but u won't provide services on time. . Vodafone is a complete crap. .
 Servie is good but takes a long time to get to a representative
 Your staff needs more information on various schemes and they need to be trained to understand and cater to clients requirement . Also 3g not being provided at a competitive rates is a cause of concern . Signal strength is just too poor at Kalyan nagar HRBR layout .
 Very nice atmosphere
 excellent
 It was nice but i want to switch on to prepaid .
 Facing billing issues from last 2 months and didn't get any satisfacory response.....bad service ever ll migrate my no from vodafone to another service provider
 Cordial approach of dealing officials
 The ambience in ur dalhousie is quite friendly . And ur staff is cooperative.to avoid over crowding add few more counters and a toilet for customers .
 No coment on store services . But Customer's veiws need more attention
 I ws satisfied wid the services this time
 The executives are not acquainted with the company's policy . They are explaining their own view as company's .
 Not worth
 Thankyou keep better service
 I am very much satisfied with the service given by executive and store manager . Problem was redressed very soon
 Excellent service from nanganallur store .
 10 very satisfied
 The owner of the store attended to me personally and the staff were very helpful and observe that they welcome every customer .
 I have been given a number which is not clean, have been getting so many calls n SMSs
 I have complained number of times for not getting network at my residence 9,Ajit society ,Near Bagikhana,Polo Club, But in vain that is why I am not recomandig VODAFONE.
 At Newly opened Patel Nagar Vodafone Store, executive have paid due respect and care
 It was well organised n d guy courteous .
 The process was kept simple and was done quickly and the suggestions were helpful as well
 The staff members specially that Sikh boy and the girl ( I don't know their names) are more cooperative thanks
 Its nice experience at every interaction in vodafone store . I really appreciate Vodafone's every management terms and every employee as well as managerin store is to Humble which gives good assurance to every customer .
 Billing is not proper
 Store associates were good, but there has to be some money kept at store in form of change, if I dont have change 100 rs in change I shoud not recharge ?
 hemselves .
 Hi I was goes u store for five times but no result with in these days but activated after long time
 Reason for visit is not fulfilled. . And delay in response
 It was a awsm experience to visit at voda office . Vry helpful staff . Would like to visit at store again .

 Good ovrrall exp . Now waiting for the resolution of my prob .
 Thanks
 My question was not replyed
 I checked on net about location of Vodafone's store ,then I selected this store, on store I asked to executive do they take request for address change ,h
 Lousy customer service . Making customers wait for ages for small things . Rude behavior of staff
 m still remains intact .
 I've visited the store for two days to change the ownership of two numbers . But the store guys declined to do that with various excuses though I have alloriginal and xerox copies of all relevant documents with me . They are just trying to misguide me and wasting my time .
 I got a fraud bill on 17 dec . I already escalated to Vodafone team . Also I had sent mail to the Vodafone team . But till today it was not fixed
 Helpful
 A simple yet appreciable service that makes coustmer smile.. .
 I was lead to there unnecessarily by another store and also by the customer care . The service level was not satisfying .
 Inspite of coming personally to vodafone gallery and telling about cancelling my BBM package as I have changed my cell; my prepaid account gets cut as soon as refill with top up ! On calling Vodafone when I get to know they don't help on phone I need to again personally to complain for the amount deducted ! Very disgusting in wasting time& money! !
 Policies of Vodafone company .
 :) good service in store:)
 Good customer interaction . Ability to understand the customer requirement and laying out solutions . Much better interface than queries over phone call .
 My rating is behalf on my experience but there is little more work you do with your store
 Very beautiful store and great service by pranav always helpful
 Support agent vishwanathan pawar rude .store did not follow queue system .
 Did not get right solution for my query
 You have been really helpful Thank you
 When you start red plan for our 3 people you don't start shareing of internet and start charging paying bills regularly then you don't add 3 membersafter buying sim and phone for them inshort vodafone want only money by cheating own loyal customers From Dr Vijay Mehta
 No friendly support . False commitments . Wrong usage of words, executives not well trained to handle customers
 Its wonderful experience now . Seemingly things have changed now .
 Best

 Service is Poor than before
 Mainly that the customer associate was very good.that's what matters finally .
 ITS OK FOR ME

 No proper and genuine solution was given by the store associate Miss Shah Deepa and I was asked to deactivate some my services which I don't want to doand the way and tone of talking was not proper
 Very good services in store

 No time slot is maintain . I waste my 40 min to meet . But could make this

 This is based om interaction and experience .
 Instead of customer care ur store person giving relavent answer
 Man is gud...short out my problem
 I hope next time will get good service
 Waiting q 45 min is toooo much  Slow service
 Store management was not soo good . Like
 I went to store with mind set to migrate to Idea as i was told from retention department that they have no plans to match my needs and idea had that butthe agents in store gave me plans that suits my needs and i was happy and it took only 5mins .
 My experience at d Vodafone was very bad.The customer care executives r very rude n non-cooperative .  -Akshay
 Exlent service
 Waiting time was higher than it should be . There were 6 counters but only 1/2 were attending customers .
 Store manegment was verry bad
 Awsme service
 You have untrained staff at your store . They have no clue how routine matters are handled
 No words
 My number was kept in safe custody with out my permission .
 GOOD
 V r happy to visit store ... . & satisfied results all members was very gud
 Good store experience because not too long to wait, associate was quick & knew the best plan for me . However, the Vodafone data service was useless - didn't work at all Mumbai , but did in Kerala . Very annoying - so not sure I want to recommend Vodafone
 nt a mail . Frankley i am not at all satisfied with your Internet and planning to change to another network .
 Your turn-around time is too slow . Also the store has neither have any books nor much products on display to keep the customers engaged while they wait .
 Very fast and good behaviour of your executive vijay at vodafone store,sri ganganagar .
 I met David Raj at the Vodafone store and he solved my problems the same day . Pls can you ensure that my sms service is not blocked in the future .
 train your technician to avoid customers often getting irritated!! !
 Simply my problem not solve and i am not helped .
 Store is good and well behaved staff but service is very low and staff does not have any right to act its not good. .
 No Time bound stor
 It is my parcepection which is base on exiperance during interaction with your pepole
 All is gud at store
 Too much waiting time, creditcard payment option unavailable in the store as well as 24 hour kiosk . Staff is not solution oriented . I will surely port out from Vodafone .
 The response is v.good.v.v.cooperative.v.polite and sincere .
 Excellent network Nice dealing
 Excellent network Nice dealing
 Staff @ store keep on talking with co satff.rather than attending costmer n soving problem s..they thinking we gone they beg something with them..... .
 after waiting for over an hour and leaving my card the manager didn't had a courtesy to call back . Mist disgusting experience .
 you should open more branches of ur store
 Welcome was good and Tushar gave me full response. . And solve my all worries immediately with smiling face
 Improve waiting times, follow the queue system, encourage discipline
 Over all good
 Good experience with ur store associate . But not with teleoperator
 The staff at your store at Wanowrie is extremely unpolitical and unhelpful and they love calling their customer to their store but are not able to offeruest for change of address has also not been resolved for my 2 numbers 8411052137, 8411052138 inspite of having handed over the application and proof ofaddress to Ms Priya . Reasons cited are difficult to digest in today's world of state of the art communication .
 It was cleam interaction with vf executive . They undrerstood problem very well and solved it . Good experience at vf store
 Superb
 She is very nice person very polite nature . Gave complete knowledge
 k he/she should not laugh . Next time i will think 100 times to go to voda store n ask for help . Give respect .
 Solving complaints took 1 and a half month, charging for service which was not provided during the complaint period, untrained staff at store who don't know to change the plan as suggested .
 Thanks for the excellent experience .
 Good handling and soft spoken.. .
 Well mannered & co-oprative staff .
 I'd given a complaint on 8th December about signal problems but was shocked to find that nothing had been done about it . And the store associate had no clue to how my problem would be solved besides emailing to higher authorities! ! Please help! !
 It's a wonderful experience . cce behavior is so kind nd helpful thank u voda
 very fast & quick service & resolution.. . Gud quality of talkng with cstmor . also understanding capacity of the problem is very gud .
 Nothing to say I am going to the consumer court for the unreasonable bill amount
 ontinued...also my and my wife's account was working and we could place and Recieve call still system was showing it in deactivate mode.. .
 I am being the vodafone customer since its YES/Hutch, i am very satisfied and had great experience during this period, but these days are really a disaster for me . Vodafone have charged me rs . 1115 for the internet charges which i have not used instead . When i asked the customer care executive, they replied to pay off as it cannot be waived off inspite of wrong charges and my call has barred . When i mailed to Nodal Officer - no reply from there too amd when i went to Store - even they arr help less to help me . I have nothing to do but to wait for the solution.. . I have paid my entire bill since i am gettong trouble from vodafone . If this is the service going on then i am not going to use vodafone again and even recommond others my frrinds and family members to not to use the vodafone . I am sorry but this time it caused very hectic situation for me . Just think a person without a phone in this type of world . Still i know - no one cares fpr what has happened and fpr this meesage too. . No one would care but to delete - am i right
 Awsome
 I M Fully Satisfied With D Executive Nd Her Behavior Was Vry Polite Nd Ur Floor Management Was Awsm, I Luv Vodafone
 I liked the promptness and courtesy shown . Besides the people were aware of what they were doing . Shahid was particularly good .
 Mini store guys don't have enough knowledge about products and procedures, Vodafone store associate guided well .

 Your store associate is very helpful
 Vodafone is the best network

 Yesterday i was vissit in your office to know mycall rate n plans shewas talking like careless .
 I got full satisfaction from the vodafone and store associate n would like to recommend it
 The gentle man over there listened me carefully and informed me the best plan and arranged the required things very fast . Further, I did not get feelingthat I m wasting my time sitting at Vodaphone store . Thanks !
 Poor perception of Customer's interest . Indifferent attitude towards any concerns raised.Least worried about losing /gaining Customer .

 My problems were not thoroughly listened seeing the importance, a positive response will be appreciated .

 Poor service, different store have different plan knowledge . Need to visit multiple site to change the plan . We have given request yesterday for plan change but not received confirmation yet , directly card suspended without intimation of payment collection many issues no body is ready to listen
 Really disappointed with the suggestions as I was told that the problem will not happen again for which I went to the store .
 Very very satisfaction
 They are not responce proprely, not take care of the customers, not solve the problems instantly after 2 - 3 we went to the office, we strictly say thatthen they will the our problem seriously other wise they are neglecting the our problems..They are not responce proprely, not take care of the customers, not solve the problems instantly after 2 - 3 times we went to the office, we strictly saythat then they will the our problem seriously other wise they are neglecting the our problems. .
 My work was done in a professional manner
 Behaviour to customer was very poor .
 Polite and prompt solution .
 The issue is still unsolved . Had visited your lower parel outlet with same complaint twice . But every had to wiat 45 mins and falsely assured had tge complaint would solved but nothing happens . Would be porting my no out for plus my two more no for sure .
 Ur staff were very cooperative
 It was smooth and perfect interaction .
 Very bad . Your staff Labony is very rude .
 Great experience
 Not complete product knowledge . Not so welcoming environment in store .
 still I don't see any request has been taken for this migration .
 REENA GOOD JOB
 Im impressed with the store infrastructure and store associate are very good in interaction and let knowing abt the product
 Response of your store associte is very good . Service is very good .
 u compeny is realy disgusting u dispointed me i wana port my no . as soon a possible.. .
 They are very quick and supportive . Help till your problem solve . thanks to having vodafone
 According to me Vodafone is miss guiding (making fool)the costumer for ISD Calling charges . Honestly I am not satisfied with this kind of policy
 I Ve been receiving messages on this new number I told them I don't need that number that has been recently deactivated by someone else I want to know when last this number got deactivated .
 Very good behaviour of associates
 Look I went to the store on Saturday then they asked me to come on Tuesday morning 11 then I went at 11 on Tuesday they then asked to come at 3 pm when Ireached 4 they changed the sim card I had to wait I felt that they were doing something else when no one is was in mini store this affected my ratings
 The token system was made very chaotic,numbers wrongly displayed for each counter . Not enough staff to handle the crowd .
 Worst mobile service
 Always love Vodafone store . .pleasant environment .
 The executives put forward false statements . My data card is not been activates for the last 4 days . They should give a honest feedback .
 My problem still exists, they are unable to solve...hopefully vodafone has someone who can solve
 You people over charge a costumer with out his knowledge . Or consent And the store guys can only explain to what is there in the computer there has to bea responsible person present to take decisions sorry . But you as a company still need to train the staff before recruiting them
 Good service
 It was a pleasant experience . As the store associate who assist me understand my concern and help me out in best possible manner .
 Very good and very pleasant service I am very happy
 She is over all best CCE. Full of knowledge . Thanks for the service
 All my rating due to my personal experience . Hope it will help u to give atleast same quality service or improve more . All the best . Ganapathi Subramanian
 The ratings are for the manager who listened to me and is trying to solve my problem created by Vodafone's delay in returning Rs . 15000/- due to mesince 12th September , 2014.

 Too long a line to wait, chaotic as to whose number was next . Need to have an electronic token system and not handwritten . Agents need to be more personable .
 Thx for being active in feedback department .
 The situation is chaotic - no respect for the token system . Tha handling by your Associates are lethargic and very unprofessional - most of us had to wwhole atmosphere is unbecoming of a Company like yours . Sorry for my harsh comment but that is reality .ait for indefinite period . You would think that you have come in a big fish market . Never would like to visit your Store if not forced otherwise . The

 Best service for me & nice person all answers are satishfied thanks for
 Over all the staff is nice but needs improvement in behaviour
 Need better service.. .
 Pls resolve my complaint asap
 Service was excellent
 The recharging/top up schemes offered are some what cheating .
 (y)
 The wait of 30 mins to get to a service agent was too long . 50% of the agents were not attending to the customers . Though there were 2 cashiers, only onewas attending while the other was watching .
 I feel very happy with excustive she is customer handling was very good .
 I still did not get the answer I was looking for . Was very happily informed that the number will be started immediately . After 15 hrs am still waiting for same . Overall Vodafone has gone down from its framed service . In fact am planning to shift to other network myself .
 Store is very cloudly... . & many custemrs are facing this problem.... .
 Pls resolve Customer problem
 tire team of Vodafone all over .
 As your slogan says, they were ready to help .
 Representative wasn't equipped to operate iPhone
 The store associate should be in collections not customer service because that's how he spoke with as if he is recovering money from me, he was rude andarrogant .
 n they will say it's technical fault or backhand department fault .
 Done as it should
 Superb and nice interactions
 Person who helped me was very helpful and cheerful
 After connecting the call we can't talk and counter is on 3 can I port this # Yes what is the way No why
 Associate was friendly..but you can have few pamplets around for the plans so that people can help themselves and reduce wait time . Also my plan was incorrectly updated and i had to get it changed again .
 Your staff is very helpful.but actually vodaphone doed not keep its word to do the job.i was told 24hrs but my post paid has not started .
 The guy over there was very polite and patiently explained everythng
 tion . 4. Thanks for ur services
 Initially no response at all . Later to resolve the problem delayed response .
 Every thing in store is fast I like that... . If u can give best offers to my sim I can give better ratings
 You guys are very helpful... .
 My query was not answered which was accepted by ur staff also .
 We will not get a proper response and solution from ur
 Vodafone family is very nice I like this
 very un like customers service and activities
 Made me wait a long time in ur store
 Whatever directions that was given for my booster pack which I followed is still not activated
 Good service.Keep it up
 Over all it is satisfactory
 Store team not responding corectly .
 Executives working in vodafone store dont have manners how to talk to a customer . Specially Mr. Narayan and Miss . Soumitra in East of Kailash Store . VeryDisappointed .
 Do some thing to reduce queue, I waited nearly one and half hour for my number
 Staff was very good understanding helpful willing to help
 You need to introduce a plan where there is more importance given to Internet, rather than local calls & SMS. I do no make many calls or send much SMS but I browse the internet a lot on my phone . Right now I'm paying high bills, I need a plan that works for me .
 Great
 Everything is fine nd well organised .
 Masy
 My rating depands the behabiour of some persone of your store . But others are not so good . It is true that everyone con,t same .
 Everything is happen smoothly .

 Good service but sometimes network problem occurs . Otherwise all over good and thanks to Ashish sharma who gives me better options
 The agent was not willing to take the network complaint, stating this is the first time so we dont have to take a complaint . He was not in the mood of helping and dint understand what im trying to tell.. .
 Revised my bill soon
 I was trying to recharge my prepaid sim with my Credit Card and they didn't let me .
 Plz try to understand costumer problem .
 10/2 Rating 1*
 They dont know how to talk to the customer and they have lots of attitude .they think they are doing us a favour by talking to us
 Dear distributors, according to me i had struggled for 5 to 6 years with various galleries all over mumbai . I'm glad it had worked here . Thanks a lot !
 Wait time was long which could hay been reduced .
 They r rrmeplying rudely
 I have not seen sincerity, promptness and stock of information among the executives . May be due to lack of training .
 Fast service
 very bad
 All is well
 Store assoaciate was polite, and he listened to my problem and gave a quick solution
 Staff is nice but seating arrangements are too short
 Nice yore staff. .
 Waiting time is more
 Your store associate was not willing to explain how can i get 3G activated but advised to call 198

 I am seriously upset with Vodafone . You disabled my roaming without notification . You are misselling your 3g products and your customer service staff isn
 3 G not working pls fix it
 I am an old man of 70. And frequently I come across with Vodafone wi fi related problems . When I seek help from the nearest Vodafone help centre at the South City Mall the people like mr . Rajesh or Mr. Kumar are very courteous helpful and knowledgable persons to solve my problems right on the spot

 Your postpaid connection is so confusing . And if i use _i`nternet the bil reaches peak . I am changing back to prepaid . Thank you
 Very satisfied for prompt and courteous service
 Firstly the token number i was gvn was161...the rep called 163 all of a sudden and then when i inquired who was allotted 161 then the rep asked me whatsthe issue ...upon hearing the issue that it is billing dispute asked me to wait...meanwhile attending to token 163 The data plan of this number was supposed to have been changed in my previous vst but it did not and i had to pay extra amount for no reason
 The associate was very helpful and patient .
 No customer delight at stores . Only rules like public sector organization . Flexibility reqd in customer service part .
 They could not satisfy me and start argument
 Yesterday i had went to Your vodafone store and the executives are not responding to customer properly . They didnt updated my payment . At mrng 10.15am itself i had paid there and they made payment at evg 6.30pm . I had waited around 8hrs this is not good . They are also not giving any recepit for the payment that we are paid . Kindly make action on that vodafone store . This is an request complaint from ur customer
 Wow super
 Cheat the customer.. .
 Behavior of your executive name - monu is very rude and he showing there attitude also not provide proper resolution of my query . Very very disappointing
 Super service I am really happy
 The service was prompt and the error was rectified .so they deserve
 Most of time ur associates are busy with each other, they do not valuebthe time of the customer, also busy with their own cell phones, as they are in hospitality industry they should greed with people with a smile but they behave like doing favour . Most of time one of ur cash vending machine is under maintenance, this should waste the time and create rush in the store . I had also seen many time that your security guards doing misbehaving with the low prof
 very nice store and there were no missing to help's customer.customer service very nice in store.thanks
 I visited the store because of 3G connection problem on my sim . First Your representative tried to misguide me by saying that it is setting problem . Aft
 Asked for a nano sim against the existing micro sim, but the store associate gave me another micro sim and activated it . I then pointed out the mistake.So he then gave me a nano sim . But as per your policy, only 1 sim activation request can be placed in a day . So unfortunately, my nano sim that I wantedcould be only activated the next day causing inconvenience .
 The support staff showed lots of patience
 Manish is genius .
 Your people not guiding correct things and ultimately I suffered
 I needed micro sim . They did not have It . They first did not know they did not have It . The way they behaved was very bad .
 Thank you
 support or any query . Also happy with voda service
 or service and unnecessary bill charges . thats all
 There is little overall scope to improve the sharpness of the service .
 Vodafone is worst
 All employee were coprative nature i satisfied from that
 Pathetic experience with Vodafone being a user from last 8 yrs planning to port the nos
 Excellent service... .
 Very best
 There is no solution regarding my network issue, almost 3 month has been past facing worst network

 Outstanding service. .
 Waiting time is high,
 Mr Khare knows how to deal with customers
 and unpaid
 Unsatisfied with internet network after store visit
 Because of Vodafone have given the best service ever .
 .
 other operator . The store staff were little arrogant and rude but they got my job done very quickly I tried the same thing in Pune store they made me ruAt my location the signal is very weak thus I don't like Vodafone much . Initially I took it for 3g internet but the speed was slow and thus switched ton for 3days and finally said that it cannot be done and I was about to switch to other operator completely but since at Asansol store I got the the job done at one go I think t that is more important than the behaviour of the staff . The gatekeeper was good.i think that it is under staffed . But I walked out happy from the store .
 excellent in service, but there are many hidden charges levied on customers that should be taken care
 Services given by this store r best ..m fully satisfied nd glad to b with this store
 Better to best services
 Any problem u r staff acts immediately & good service
 The answer got from them is not appropriate to the questions asked to them .
 teamwork.. .
 Nobody has time to wait for an hour for silly replacement of a sim card . U should have more executives in the store .
 Good service.... .
 Other network roaming Free . Why in Vodafone charging ?
 Quick assistance and prompt reply
 Simply wow.. .
 GOOD
 If dealing with an old lady is important, then please do understand their difficulties.. . This is the third time I have send my nephew to set up 3g for my connection . I hope it gets done at least now finally
 The executive is good in communicate with customers and she's has very good smiley face .
 I will give you the comments after the service request is complied with .
 Good understanding and cooperation .
 The store was easy to locate and easily accessible; the staff was courteous and professional in their conduct; the store associate solved my query satisfactorily and above all I am happy with the Vodafone mobile telephony services . Keep it up .
 Revalue your system otherwise costumer will port
 Poor service small staff etc
 Wow
 he desk to deal wid my problem .
 Customer service representative at store I visited was prompt . Would not recommend Vodafone as my connection isn't always the best . Did not like that your store is open from 11-8- that makes it difficult for people with long hours
 my work is complit urjent
 The CENTER has understood the problem and solved immediately
 Vodafone service is the best .
 Simply ur answer is we have already posted & we will send duplicate bill...till date i have not reveived any bill for this month
 I come from Canada and the staff was able to give us advice but, did not actually help us and instead told us which shop we could go to which is loweringyour chance for service but, overall the advice was good but, not A-1.
 If u can please dont create issues which gives problem for normal person and try to resolves problems instantly because dont take others as fools and do
 Good customer care ,clarifies doubts and follow up of complaints
 I had gone to the store for a new nano sim . The first time they told me to get original Id prof and the next time I went with original prof he told me to get the person but my dad is out of state .
 Very good
 Very good
 Iam proud to use your service and iam satisfied
 People at Vodafone store didn't try to respond to my questions, they just had one and repeated and recorded answer to all the questions and queries I had, they answer to questions asked and thus understand our concern
 I like vodafone network
 I liked the person who attended to me . He was very friendly & helpful, & got my work done .
 Pleasing ,useful ,informative response
 Gentle behave and quic service .
 Correct and prompt information was provided . Good customer service . Thank y
 ood experience
 Associates are not fully equipped with the information and also not ready to help and resolve customer problems instead creating problems . No service oriented people in the store . Please learn and practice customer service, make every customer happy . Thank you .
 According to my personal experiences with telecom or any other I have had the best so far . This is the reason beyond my ratings .
 I stepped in to ur office to turn my postpaid to prepaid, But... . 1. There was no one to help me or rather guide me how to take the coupon . 2. I had toremind your team to adjust my deposit amount to settle the bills...(i wonder if the company has instructed team for the same)... .
 Yes team will good and responsive at store they are taking care very nicely
 The time taken to activate my replaced sim took a long time . I had to wait for more than 5 hours for it to get activated and it happened only after my second visit to the store . It could have been fine if the service time was faster .
 When I reached C care v fone executives forced me to wait without reason and finally told dealing pers is not available and asked to come next day, however I had a small query to convert from postpaid to prepaid .
 Response at KHARGHAR store is slow . Vodaphone is good brand, but service personnel needs to be more active .
 All good, except wait time at the store
 Half of the counters were closed and customers were waiting much for their turn
 Good .
 Overall store receiving is nice
 I am really hate Vodafone.because i met many billing problems.i have 2gb inbuilt 3g data free but u charged around 3times continously .
 I am not happy with your service .
 fast & best service
 I meet Mr. Vikas, he was very polite, he understood my problem very nicely, he is really very cooperative . Great representative for Vodafone. .
 r stand their for next turn . If one of the enployees looks at me and informs me than I am assured that I will be served well . At the end I was served welNot every staff members looked happy . I sort of had the feeling as if I walked into a Government office . I was not informed about should I sit and wait ol by one of the employees - everything I wanted was sorted out in just one visit .
 Exelnt services . . Experiencd guy given proper and valuable info . . Bright future ahead .
 Ur store z realy @wÃ‚Â£- $_oxm_XXe ! Bcoz u'l help me in geting my num back that 2 vry fast . Thank u'l !

 Overall interactions were nice but the services provided by the store still had lot's of improvement scope .
 You are cre having more product knowledge
 Seriously not interested
 Every time while pay the card swipe machine not work
 Keep up the perfect service for customers and it should be fast at ur backhand team
 I have been asking them since past four months that I want my Vodafone number to be converted into prepaid from postpaid but they kept on delaying givingme lame excuses .
 Need more stores like this
 The executive was rude and reluctant to assist solving the problem
 the time in which commits 2 me by the executive of voda store whose name is aarti had sort out the balance issue in the given up time period .
 because all of that i understand and the person is very good and helpful . thank you for solve my problem .
 lessly overcooked bureaucracy .
 Your store associate persons are good bt they need more improvement how to serve the customer
 Staff is not competent enough . They don't know and say yes, later they discuss among themselves and say no . At last, the customer suffers . All are good but in my case, it irritated me to the highest level .
 Prompt service and excellence
 You need to expand your stores bcz they r so tidy at many places
 Excellent Service. .

 Hope u give me so free credits !
 I called up customer care prior to visiting the store .. . Bt i was advised differently in store even though i carried all docs mentioned by customer care. . I would hav to visit the store again. . Also the store personnels are not amicable .. As a customer i was not happy with the attitude of the store personnels .. . I felt like i shud hav visited a different store .
 No proper response to the customer issue.As I made a complaint abt the wrongly charged in the bill .
 I LIKE THE RESPONSE BY UR TEAM AT ALL TIMES
 I bought a 3G dongle couple of days ago . Activating it and make it use was a nightmare fr me . I went into 100s of problems before getting it activated . Complete false info from customer care and even from Vodafone store representatives . I was about to throw this peice of junk away . Atlast I figured it out
 My problem is whenever i try to recharge my no online everytime it got rejected . I have tried from myvodafone app, vodafone.in , paytm, freecharge etc . B
 Welcome your customers with smile, and make them feel that you are there to help them .remember you have a job because of your customers
 Good resolution of my request
 Service wass vry fast . N i got all d answers of my problem quickly.this is the reason i like to use vodafone services
 Now I am using post paid Vodafone its amazing but some time my bill is higher than usage and I am not get any details about that .
 Helpful
 and then quietly and efficiently set about resolving them . I was heard . Understood . I got the answers I needed . I am very happy . Keep it up !
 Problem has to solve in store itself .it shouldn't be postponed further.a person has to be employed such that he can capable to solve problem store itself(no need of complaint booking) by this Service to customer will not postponed which gives a good impression .
 Nice service by vasai store cordially Nitin Baraiya
 Al iz well .
 I am categorized by your company a valued customer since 1997 and not a single default in payment for more than 200 months and i have been shifted to individual from demo in 2006 and still you have barred outgoing calls on account of demo sim and i was asked to pay current bill payment of rs3110/- towards shifting from demo to individual without my knowledge which was to be reduced by monthly credit of monthly plan this was a complete shock when Mr joukim told me that your number will be "PD"
 Good helping
 never be acceptable at Vodafone . I am afraid are you second reliance in making . Change the quality of services or face the music .
 t got till now I approached store for same complaint they have raised ticket for that, but I have not received any response regarding that .
 You may call to know the reason
 Less time taken . No queue .
 Mr.Avik Sen is very helpful and understands a customers needs well

 Good service
 Excellent service , super prompt, quick no additional hassles and everything worked as promised
 It took me 20 minutes, 2 visits, and almost not possible for a change of payment cycle . Staff very adamant .
 Mr.Sujit Help Me To Solved My Problems. .
 Roaming pack although cancelled then also its charges are included for january in the bill received
 Illinformed n immatuer staff missleading information will port out soon .
 Recharge Services are misleading.no proper details are provided.customers are not informed in advance before charging penalty / fees.not satisfied with the services at all .
 Issue is still not resolved or it didn't help in walking into the store
 Balvinder responce is commercial and courtious also friendly
 The store is good . But the executives working there are ill informed .
 I have been asking for a hard copy of the bill for over six months . The bill goes straight to accounts who pays it on the due date . This was the practicefor the last many years . This was changed by you all unilaterally inspite of my request to go back to the hard copy . I keep getting calls for the unpaidbill I keep emphasising that a hard copy is needed to pay the bill . This cat and mouse game goes on and on but a hard copy of the bill is never ever sent on time . Needless to say my line gets cut which irritates me more as the fault lies squarely with you for not sending the bill . All the other bill comein hard copy and are paid promptly . Just send the bill on time and all the hassles are over . I need a hard copy of the bill there are over twenty connections so why should my bill not come ?
 U give wrong info at the time of offerin new connection . And ur starting bill cycle calculation is not favourable for customer
 He told visit to Vodafone store, they can only solve the matter, so I told him to give me in writing . He denied . Then I told him, call on customer care,
 Dont have time to write if you all really wants to know then call me
 First send my free Internet data bundle..then I'll reply
 Poor comms, not willing to help . Hardly understand what the customer wants
 They did't close my problame
 Quick response to query

 I had visited the store to complain about wrong billing done towards my mobile data usage . I was told that nothing can be done from stores end and I haveforced to switch my carrier to some other operator .
 The associate listened to the issue carefully and delivered correct solution which helped me a lot . @rup
 Best service
 Unsatisfctry . Service . Ur ppl don't value custmer's time . Poor public reltion .:-_XX_! !
 Quite happy with the service at the Vodafone gallery . Keep up the good work !
 Service is good
 I had internet speed problem since last 4 months, but couldnt solve it because going to gallery is waste of time, and on the phone they keep us on hold.g to gallery again and again . Hope this msg will have some effect .
 I am satisfied but the role of miss radhika is good and she has taken the issue in a very great manner.also here my view is that the behaviour is not upt
 Took me over 2 Months to activate Vodafone Red Family plan . Store executives lacked ownership in solving the issue .
 Courteous knowledgeable & thorough .
 **** u again
 Vodafone is best.. . Good employees,,,,
 in cities and towns .
 The person (sachin) hw attend me was very helpful and friendly .
 My sim was faulty . He argued tht I had cut the sim to fix it in my iphone which was not the case as it was nano sim only . He he tried to charge me for that . for that I had to point out that faulty sim has to be replaced . Then he asked some1 and agreed . I got the service but not hassle free .
 ionship manager has been assigned yet as per commitment
 Network keeps on fluctuating tremendously and everytime it is not possible to stay in a not reachable mode .
 She is more customer friendly .
 Your people are talking to me in professional way i felt happy

 Lack of coordination Too small a place Sequence not maintained
 Quickly attended by the staff . Very cooperative, courteous and helpful front office person
 Their involvment
 Your associates are both helpful and efficient . Problem solving abilities are excellent and their approach in explaining does not appear very stereotypic
 Because they attend customers in quiet good manner and make them satisfy
 It was great experience at your store, all associates were very helpful and knowledgable .

 1. We have 10 simcards in one family at my home but we are struggling low signal network since 2 years .

 My exp is vodafone executive in nt to srcs in our work..only give excue to cutomer.. .
 Very good services and excelent network with realy affordable call rates
 Store person d were cooperative and well behaved . If they are note customer oriented and service oriented it will give more customer satisfaction .
 Not satisfied service
 In the last few days my calls have been barred twice with no valid reason given at various levels . For a person who has not changed his number since mobile telephony started - it was a shock and disgrace . I still don't know when Vodafone will do it again creating feeling of fear . Regards Aditya Vikram
 The experience of the store is mesmerising, it is unforgettable . The staff of the store interact with clients sweetly
 rt and felt I know more than chat support person 3. When we went to Vodafone office resolved in 5 min So wasted time on chat and ivrs . Money to travel.1. Based on usage I decided to change plan and neither 121 nor 111 helped 2. Online chat option told me, new plan will get activated on billing cycle sta

 Average
 All service are good and excellent .

 Very very dissatisfied
 Thanks, for giving me an opportunity so first thing is I am not able to get the signal and no net connectivity secondly when I when to the store to submit the bill and I had to return because there system was not responding second when I when they did not give me the bill receipt saying that printer was out of order . Do you think that.people are sitting free to visit the store for always ? I was really disappointed . I am not at all happy with the serviceof the store as well as all other services .
 Bad
 The place is very noisy
 We complained about data speed but still no any improvement . Help me to use the 3G with high data speed
 Very satisfy
 onsible inspite of repeated complaints.Even all are free but they do not call customers with out wait.Very very bad management
 I am a old customer of Vodafone . I went to the Vodafone store of Punjabi Bagh, and one of the senior most manager didn't know how to talk to a customer.I told him that I am not satisfied with my bill and I want you guyz to take out a solution and I am ready to pay the correct amount . But in any case I will not pay such amount because I can't pay . He started laughing and making fun and didn't have the courtesy to talk to a customer . I need a solution formy current bill .
 I went to mohali vodafone office and asked about my internet problem . One of them told me that my internet service is active from vodafone end . They askme to reinsert my sim or restart my phone . But when my internet service was not working after doing as per instructions, i called on 198. One of executive told me that my APN is not attached . I requested him to do the needful as i want my internet active . He said work is done on my part and asked to waitfor 4 hours . I called on 198 at abt 4 pm, yesterday . Till now my net is not working . So i replied in negative for all questions .
 Good service..helping..good communication
 My complaint is regarding my bill at d time of porting in I was told dat after using 1 GB data the over usage charges are nomoinal and in my bill it added rs 920 for using 230 MB extra data its very disappointing
 Thanks for help
 It was fast, easy and all my requests were fulfilled .
 Nonsence talk No ans prply No value of customer
 Horrible staff . They don't know what to do and how to resolve problems . Every problem needs a supervisor .
 Thanks
 Waiting time
 I found Vodaphon service provider aren't interested to attend customers Few staffers goes inside and came back very late Sometimes they don't know procedures and asking other attendees simply wasting time I feel they want clear store For gossiping about nothing

 I would like to recommend Vodafone to my friends as Service is excellent . Your store associates are very competent and cooperative towards customers . They guide properly and patiently to the queries . Thanks
 peaceful reply . short Conversation . prompt feedback .
 Its take me three days Togo to the vodafone store for the lock simcard.please make it quick in one day . .
 Unable to get incoming and outgoing calls without any reason for last 3days
 Prompt service & very friendly
 Look in the training of your employees to be efficient professionally . Keep a comment card in the store to be filled by clients and have surprise checksto actually see the functioning to achieve a moderately good service as the present is so poor .
 Yes
 Since its more than two months my request for call summary and call cost information is not informed after ending the cal . And my request for DND is alsopending .

 Being a Senior citizen I was glad u had special service for senior citizens & all people who attended to me were very helpful & cooperative . ThaNks verymuch . Do continue your good work & all the best to your store & your Co.

 Very poor service....No value of customer
 The employee is talking wid v politely .. He also heard my all problems v carefully ..
 No details for unbilled amount Every thing depending on your systems !
 Service was prompt . As soon as I entered, I was helped with token . Person attending to me was courteous and had a quick solution and suggestion for my query .

 Very patiently undrstood my query and im very much satisfied
 Your store associates are a lot to improve.I went more than 2 times for a duplicate sim . And I appreciate your free service providing duplicate sim absolutely free . Thank you :)
 Store is near to my house and well accessible with friendly staff
 Your vodafone sevice is best among other but most important factor is that improve and stayed continue
 Sugession sent
 Everything is fine . Please refine your bill payment desk's response time . Its extremely slow .
 All is well but service of Vodafone like calling rate cutter not available previous offer
 FREE
 Manage queue
 Ur any employee or care officer are not well...trained . after 3 or 5 years...vodafone co.'s service...is so easy fast & clear..but at this time....no marks only zero .
 I was really satisfied . I had issues with my sim card nd went to the store nd the store person resolved the issue in less than 5 mins nd gave me the new sim .
 The store is highly unorganized
 No comments
 Excellent service immediate solution
 Good response and good knowledge on the products
 Cce behavior was good . Vs basti service is very good
 Hiring another agency (smart step)which give wrong imformation to the customers
 As a customer we has to wait for longtime for our turn after taking a token,we are made to stand unhelped with limited seating arrangements
 I love vodafone
 Vodafone Commits false statement . And makes people fool
 In adequate space for people, no one to guide, non availability of nano SIM (for I phone) for Maharashtra region in Mumbai , though micro sim was available . So even if you purchase an Apple I6, you can't really use if you are registered for Maharashtra circle .
 It is annoying to say the same thing so many times . Please read mail sent by navdp@yahoo.com addressed to appellate mail ID.
 Associate has good communication skills they are well trained how handle the customer . ..I m very unsatisfied with..Vodafone network service . .
 Work rqstd was confirmed as done but it was never done n now i am made to run around for last one month without gettng relief
 3 star
 Very quick services by Voda stores as well as ur network . Thanks .
 People were cooperative . But waiting time was a disaster..this reduced rating
 Behavior&tackimg manner not appriciable perticulaly Mr Parichy & his imchage,requar some improvement in dealing custmer.Sitting arrangent not sufficient in stor .
 Your token sys is broken i had to abort my line because of inac tion
 Last time I am rating 10 out of 10.. . Bt I am wrong. . I am n, t giving any service what they are committed last 6 days.. .  So I am very dissatisfied & disappointed .. . If it is continuing , I am thinking to quit your service. .
 Providing good assistance
 I got what I expected without any hassles, just that I had to wait about 20 minutes before my turn came .
 All r good,especially the store Associate, nice behaviour
 The receptionist didn't talk to me in Marathi, but I saw her talking in Marathi with staff . It is very shameful .
 Store is not managed efficiently nor comfortably..inadequate seating..aircon not functioning..staff to customer ratio too high and counterproductive
 Quick attending , fully and satisfactory response regarding my query .
 I was treated excellently . Politely . I was offered genuine help .
 Sim replaced in seconds n solved the problen
 Genuine
 Quick response... . Polite talks... .
 Network issue is still continue..i ll go for the mnp idea...kindly call not this number..my another no is 93 762 64 350
 Mr. Asis arora is nice man and very helpful . Always cheerful and help us to guide well . Rest of staff is so so and are not such responsible to customers . But overall ok .
 Goood store
 I got all the information I need with nano sim
 Internet network issued my phone so solved it .
 Having Roaming Gprs changes more, as per ur executive update we have to set mannual network, by default it is automatic feature in hand set, and if it isgoing to search other networks thatmeans Vodafone network is not good .
 Good interaction with customers, service is good. . I hope you resolve my issue soon
 It was very well maintained . Neatly organised . Store associate had answer to my every question . Very freindly and prompt .
 There are 10 help counter but only 4 help counter are attending customers so it's late
 Yr rep was responsive, assuring & seemed capable for a change !
 ling abt these problem and ur executive s just watching tat .
 Worst service
 THE ACTION SHALL BE AS QUICK AS THE ACTION SHOWS WITH NEW BUSINESS.
 Listing custmer camly not ireyaying for reprted qution gives more satisfaction to costoner
 The executive was polite,helped me understand different policies of vodafone and gave a good and quick service .
 Have to wait to talk.but while the service person are good . Saugata he is very polite and answers to every query.my new number was used by someone else .
 I was so helpless when my prepaid card was dameged i was feeling so bad to go in vodafone store and say that my card is damaged and i was not having to much of time also but when i went there i was wiating for only 20 to 25min and they called my no and had solve my query in just 2 to 3 question which wasgr8 and alos the givin service was gr8
 They r very active they tell us things in short way so we can understand
 Approachable, spacious easy to reach and excess .
 Quick and satisfied service
 Very cooperative and understanding staff
 Good experience from Vodafone store
 1. The people in vodafone shop did not respond well when i asked for prepaid conversion 2. When i asked for a new prepaid connection, they have a sim andomer useful companydidn't explain the plan 3. When i went to pay 63 rs activation first recharge, she refused to take as she doesn't have change for 70rs . It is not a cust
 Store associate was very helpful . Only u need to increase the nos of helpdesks as there was too much waiting .
 Ur emploies r beheaveing like Gvt..emploies.They r not giveing any respect to even seanier citizens like me
 So lazy store associate
 I recommend that vodafone is very bad company
 After visiting so many times no use of Vodafone store . They take complaints but wont take any action .
 Lack of proper training to deal with customer . Shortage of Manpower & space . Takes too much of time for small problem .
 Very good,I like your network
 But my time is costly
 Taking more time .
 I had been there with a problem and that was solved with atmost satisfaction. .
 Good rapport with customers Prompt service However cramped space and nothing to keep u occupied while u wait
 I got a fantastic service thks
 Vodafone is a theift compony . Compony cheat the all customer in their billing system .
 I had been to your Vadapalani Office on 9th November 14 and told them I would be going out of Chennai . I requested for the incoming calls free tarrif and the concerned person has taken my identy proof, informed me that there will be a charge of Rs.75 for the same and I said OK. It seems that he has notacted as per my period 19th Nov Rs.13.50 and 19th Dec.305 or so . I am totally upset on your service and if you do not vaive this amount, I will haveto switchover to some other company.yesterday I tried more than 14 times to contact your Nodel Officer,but it was ringing and no response .
 Gud experiance
 Very helpfull
 The idea of cash collection at separate counter must be changed to all counters , as it leads to lot of confusion ... . Moreover the person sitting at thecash counters are pretty ignorant & more often rude .. . Cash collection at each desk would speed up the entire process & better customer experience . Mypointed .
 I want to replacement of Vodafone mobile number but for this my number converted to post paid .
 Your queueing system is broken
 All are good but there is no immediate update of bill amount and it away from residential place
 Coz...i'm satisfied for what they'vd done and for how they treay customer.... .
 It was excellent.for sr citizen an official to exclusively deal to reduce waiting for them
 The executive do not tell the proper document to be submitted while changing post to pre . Once the token is taken and query is taken and if immediately Icome after half an hr getting the documents I am told to take the token again ...because I want to convert my postpaid to prepaid . Thirdly after lookingat the documents I am sent back again saying the photograph is not proper....really pathetic to treat a 6 year old customer like that .
 Very good services
 Very helpfull
 Very nice
 She is very helpful
 Action was taken quickly by ur store
 No one can get through the vodafone . Hatsoff to my vodafone
 Very bad
 Executive attended me either gave any solutions or she made an attempt to resolve .
 Service not up to the mark and other competition
 I happy your service
 Over all good but some time our much time spent 4 smallwork
 Very helpfull... .
 Good
 Waiting period is too much And from 8 counters 2 counters person were not there Many more things

 Vodafone has been reliable to me for last 10 years .
 Your service very poor .

 I am totly satisfied with service given by cce Gaurav Pandey and 3G network of vodafone and I hope Vodafone will lnch 4G soon. .
 Customer carr saying pre to post migration can be done after 90 days . But mini store executive saying it can be done only after 6 months... . actually which one is correct ? ??

 Got what I came for in 2 minutes . Keep it up .
 Overall the set up is good but I had to wait longer because I was not in the priority list !
 Since my problem is not resolved,the invalid balance deductions has not been refunded that's why the ratings that I gave are low .
 They listen and did
 Environmenjtis very good and good service provided by executive
 The new store in Rajkot at 150ft ring road is much better than any other store in Rajkot as kalwad road and dhebor road store.. . I had many bad experiences at kalawad road store....bt the new one 150ft ring road store gave me great experience.... .
 Over all experience was good

 Nokia's service is the best other any company.....flexibilitiy of any parts of mobile......_i` luv nokia 2 much... .
 Excellent customer support
 My first connection was vodafone . I love its services and the offers that it provides . Especially the happy hours and individual offers are most welcome.Overall I LOVE MY ZOO ZOO. I LOVE VODAFONE
 No complit my problum misbehave
 If you stop your fake billing and fooling the customers Vodafone can become the most apt cellphone company anybody can suggest .
 It was very bad experience . No interaction with customer no value to customer I may go for portability within a short duration of time and worst experience of my life with Vodafone store
 Service is good however very slow.took 1hr for my no . In queue..just for sim upgrade task . Probably small tasks like this can be clubbed together on a different counters which will reduce the time .
 Very good
 Bad behabour
 They made us visit 4 times just for replacement
 Good
 Its not an easy task to get free time and go to vodafone store.if they cannot resolve our problem there is no benefit to go there.so give them some morepower or authority so they resolve customer problem on the spot and make the customer satisfied .
 Your technicians in Vodafone stores are very helpful . But when I call Vodafone, I get nobody to answer my questions - Subodh Kumar Ray
 My network problems are not solved till now... . The cracking sound is still heard when I call from mah side
 Details not informed completely . Dufferent people are telling about different requirements
 Staff is good but mr ravi is very good and very helpful for all customer
 Address change request send twice with all papers and not yet done due to staff negligence my no is not active
 Waiting for number allotted . May extend cooperation for change of high denominations to low . This may facilitate payment at kiosk .
 Rating is 0
 Customer friendly service ,,, every time I found same executive to assist me ,,,, feel privilege every time,,, knowledge level of executive is very sound
 I am very unhappy and thinking to switch over to other service provider if I come across the same issues, I am a old client of Vodafone and don't expectall these, thanks
 Vodafone has gone pathetic day by day . Rather than improving it's getting worsen day by day . Due to a some technical error I am being charged for data usage despite of being charged for 2 data packs in a single month . Strange . And with that too one of the data pack is unlimited . After requesting to resolve the issue the best thing happened-my data plan is restricted,am unable to use Internet now . Waiting for the issue to get solved now . No option left .
 Keep it up
 good experience
 Store associate was very unfriendly
 our product - Booster package which was earlier available but since discontinued .
 Store was organised and process was simple and effective .
 Every thing is fine but we have to wait for long time
 Your associate doesnt know how to treat customer . Almost all of your customer care and associate gives wrong information . Now the situation is that I am thinking of to use this number .
 Frienfly staff, quick to attend, time to process, clarity of information
 Good reception/ satisfying work for which i had gone
 All queries were answered satisfactorily. .
 Wow appearance and kindly approach good behaviour keep it up

 Service is very good
 Your staff is very Unprofessional and very rude . They think they are doing a big favour on us by helping us also the information sometime they give is not helpful and not fully correct . No respect for senior citizens . Very bad and unprofessional all in all .
 Gentlemen at counter had complete knowledge, knew process, was cooperative, had patience, smiling . Happy to help
 My request solved immediately
 Very good
 The staff is courteous and helpful
 Vodafone on the whole looks very adamant and they are not interested in HNI customers . It is my personal opinion only .
 Executive don't have any knowledge . Does not provide and reason for the problem .
 possible breaches of confidentiality with my personal documents .
 Yes i am very happy with Vodafone Network and i thinking take another Connection if service is same . Thanking you, Yours . Abdul Rashid
 Staff must be trained

 your corporate plans for schneider electric are not good when compared with airtel..but your signal strength in our circle is very good..so if come up with few good plans like as airtel, i think many might port from airtel to u. .
 operations ! !
 No proper staff ,while I was waiting at counter it took 15 minutes to meet me even there was no rush staff was chatting with there friends
 Simply awesome
 Service was good .........But It can be improved to some extent like by giving more details to customer and talking to one customer at a time... .
 Excilent expirence
 Very good responce..but little delay
 I am holding Vodafone number for past 10 yrs but still I don't receive any premium service, there are mistakes in billing . Wrong scheme informed & non proper customer service
 VERY GOOD. HOMEE HINDUSTANI.
 Pathetic experience with vodafone call center and store . I am planning for MNP.
 I use ur connection from a long time, last month i have transfer to dehradun, i request to change my connection from post paid to pre paid, after waitingan hour ur store incharge use abusing words whle my family was there

 Kind cooperation. . Healthy working environment for girls also and competent staff .
 Ur stores n assistants r gud well located . But more than that I hav liked ur cellular services, by far the best I hv used . Also a fren if mine works in Vodafone, I liked the culture of ethics u try to imbibe in ur employees .
 We have 300-400 corporate connections . Finally we have to review this also, after going to office .
 Incomplete information and abrasive behaviour at mini store as well as the Vodafone store . Non emphatic way of answering shows how well they serve their
 Vodafone store is best for customor

 I was expecting a quick solution but there was really very lengthy process to get the solution .
 It was nice experience with the Vodafone service I had .customer services are also appreciable.thank you
 Vodafone service is very superb
 Service today was absolutely excellent the agent was awesome full marks to her
 Did not get complete attention .
 U guys make the customer to hate ur network.....am *** ing daily
 one store for 40 mins waiting for my turn just to hear a 2 minute response of the executive telling me to email again was highly disappointing . I guess,
 Store timing should be more . Keep it open on Sundays and public holiday . Have more no of stores
 texted 0 by mistake, I meant 9
 Not satisfied with the Vodafone service at all
 Why ignor my problem
 In ur store they dont try to know my problem they saying only (popat panchi)there's . Plz call me i will share more to improve .

 A detailed letter is sent to CC dept . just 10 minutes ago . A quick action will be appreciated so as to avoid double billing and penalty for late payment,if any , for no fault of ours; and there is still a week left before the due date of payment of our first bill which should have been a combined one forour dongle and our mobile phone . Sounds complicated ? Not our making . Your staff did it so . Please see the attachment to our today's letter for detailed explanation . Good luck to you and us if you could coordinate with your staff at vodafonecare.mum@vodsfone.com
 Very gud service i am happy with executive

 Executives service is very good.... . Store was very good..... . I am so happy for the service..... .
 The guys are not trained and not at all coustmer friendly
 Query and unknown voicemail charges remained unanswered . Was being constatly asked to sign up fr a new service even though my existing charges not explained .
 Good service thnx
 I find it very poor service in a phone shop when Staff such as Etka ? are more interested in their own private conversations rather than solving a Custome
 For100% customer satisfaction ... .
 Was satisfactory
 Short n sweet reply
 No problem
 Customer friendly setup I like that

 Issue is still not resolved . Rep at the store treated me well when she wanted me to fill the feedback form . When I came back with my issue again . She was least bothered to help me and kept me waiting . Eventually I stepped out from the service center with my unresolved issue . Thanks for no help . If u want satisfied customers at least resolve the issue for them .
 Good Service

 When I went the store on Saturday they told that it will happen in 4 hrs . But when I called the customer there the store guy has not raise the concern.I have to follow this . They send this request in Monday . They have to understand the customer .
 I had taken a new postpaid number and it took more than 2 working days to get activated . Rest, the service is fine
 I didn't have to wait there as I was entertained as soon as I got there . Plus the service provided by your associates was great .
 Executive was food

 Very good service overall
 Good response and service
 Best network in gujarat . . . .
 SERVICE WAS NICE

 expect this type of service from vodafone .
 Your staff gang up against a customer instead of trying to help.customer come in at 10am, staff at 10.30am.What kind of organization is yours ?
 I have an enormous bill due to miss guidance from a Vodafone executive & the service centre people haven't been able to solve it Kindly look into it Coz j am not paying this hefty bill
 Customer service is not satisfied . I raised a complaint last month and again i faced the same problem this month also . Please concentrate on this

 Good sarvice
 Service is better than before
 I went to take nano card and was told that server is off and will take 30 to 60 minuts . I had to wait . Manager was not there because there id no manageron sundays . In past also whenever i went for any service at this centre its time cosuming . One has to wait atleast for 30 minuts . You should increase number of persons or do anything , only thing is customer should not made to wait standing as waiting seats are also less . Your campany is loosing reputation because of this .
 My problem is still unsolved
 Very good

 I personally rate your support as full rating on rated scale whichever . Wish you for future endeavors. .

 Completely unprofessional attitude and not customer friendly
 It's because. . we want more quick service. . and response and feedback from your side .

 Lousy service . Cannot address simple problem . I will terminate my service with Vodafone

 Good Experience
 Worst customer service. . Firstly he was wasting time . And next I sent my staff to change postpaid to prepaid . They said in person should be coming to snal is 20kms far.ign the documents . I went with all my proof . Not original one though. . I took xerox of all. . He said he won't accept and I have to get original . As origi
 Sometimes vodafone associates are misguiding customers.They didn't try to undestand the condition of customer .
 That person is very friendly & very nicely treat me
 Store associate was very supportive and well behaved
 My problem regarding the data pack and bill is not solve yet .
 I didn't require to wait much . Customer care was efficient and was very helpful .
 . The reason for porting out is terrible network . I also complained for network problem but no steps were taken .
 Rude behaviour, poor knowledge, confusing customers, poor management, not maintaining queue, staffs prefer gossiping while customers wait for longtime for a simple work . What is most important is the way they behave !! People like Gautam harassing customers !! !
 The executive didnt know what to be done, he was not very clear .
 Gud serives and way of reciving the customers
 Cool staff nice ambience
 Your facilities are really good
 Ur cce is very helpful and I appreciate his way of talking
 A lot of problem...not able to right on text. .
 Very courteous n helpful staff No waiting as there were not many people there
 The reason why I gave such rating is that net is really very fast and good and accessible as well as the service is .
 Love you Vodafone
 The store is always crowded but still being managed in a better way
 Vodaaaaafooonnneeee
 Its realy gud n awsum cust serv
 My work was only for 5 minutes hardly and i was wait there around 1 hr there that time . After meet with executive i feel good from their response ,.

 Vodafone is best network in mumbai , customer service is good as well ! But too costly

 Complaint for network congestion 4 time bt still problem has not solve . Unfortunately I am porting to some other networks .
 Inadequate information . No proper suggestion given .
 Good khowledge..im satisfied
 Very rude approach .
 Well! The store representatives are quite pleasant and were patient enough to clarify the things .
 Very good experiance iam really appreciate from you thanks
 With out using any phone calls or any massage or any mms I have been ducted 150 rupees from my account
 Vodafone does not know how to value their customer . I am vodafone customer for last 10 years . I had to just get Micro sim however rather than helping me . I have been given very bookish reply . I am law abidided citizen and vodafone can get all my documents checked . If u really value your customer then some representative should call so that I can explain my problem
 Service needs to be improved . It is not very satisfactory .
 Even after having paid for it . I had to re-visit the store again the next day because they forgot to add credit and data to my sim . Could not reach the store on the phone .
 All the store member are good and they doing there work properly . I satisfied with store member works .
 have written my complain .
 Bad behaviour no proper response nd resolution.I want to change my data plan given request still it is not done
 I was waiting ur office 20 minits no chair only standing
 experience was good,
 ing a copy of my adhar card to get the matter examined by higher authority . Thanks to him but if adhar card is not a valid Id then why I was told by ur customer care executive . Its strange . Needs clarification whether adhar is a valid Id or not .

 I am waiting for my offers to get activated on my number . While covering from Reliance to Vodafone, they said I will get special offers with in 15 days to my number . But till now, I didn't got any offer . Got fed up . I continued till now with basic tariff pack only, without any offers . Really got fed up inwaiting for offers.... .
 None of the executive have any willingness to resolve the issue . It happened only myself visiting the store frequently . Shame on all unprofessional act c
 Customer Service
 sible to block it at Vodafone's end and I have to take care . Good efficiency in getting my address change updation hence better ratings
 The Answers Were Pretty Straightforward, Clearing All My Doubts Very Easily . That's All . Thank You!
 They didnt attend me at all . The staff along with the security guard gave me token no and kept me waiting for 20 mins while they themselves were busy chit-chatting . There was no other customer in the shop . I requested the guard to tell me how much time will it take approximately . He went inside and someonow i'll change the service only . Distgusting customer help centres.e shouted from inside at high pitch, "yar, yeh mera lunch time hain . Tumhei dikhta nhi h" I went to get my plan changed from post paid to pre paid . But n
 Service was prompt n the lady who assisted us was very helpful n quick . A big thank you
 ous Scraching . I Call 198 , They Told Me To Visit Any Vodafone Store with it they will Change it by its serial No, I Visit Satarday And They Tell, This Prob . Can Only Be Solve By The Manager,he Absent Now Visit Monday . So Its Just A Lose Of Time And Money To Visit There . Do U Think It Make Any Sence ? I not Think So . Resulting Such Feedback .
 Every month I need to go Vodafone store or in one months I need to call 10 times to customer care otherwise they are not solving my any ISSUES.
 Very helpful mentality for your staf expecialy abilash.. . THANKU
 Ur people hav no manners to behave wit customers
 Very happy with vodafone
 I satisfy with prompt & smoothly handling my problems/ questions & give proper ans . Thanks once again
 I have sent a mail describing the complete scenario . I hope you people will look forward to it . I have mailed you on vodafonecare.mum@vodafone.com
 Satisfactory service
 Your initial sales team is aggressive . Other follow up process persons are customer unfriendly . Further, my service was unceremoniously stopped, withoutcourtesy of advance information .
 The representative got my query with very little inquiry
 Horrible customer care . We cannot reach u on phone and should walkin to store all time .
 Actually i am fully satisfied with ur service . i was trying to take Vodafone service from 15 days . But it couldn't possible . I literally appreciate forur good and very fast service . Thanks i will visit again .
 Very nice,full introduction,complitly information
 Should provide offers who ever visit stores
 Dissatisfaction
 Vodafone network I am getting only 2 points and 3G is not connecting at home, also HSR layout store does not have change to give it to the customer whereI required computer generated receipt to claim my bill . Your HSR layout store staff said debit card machine not working and no change hence he was not a
 Satisfied
 I travel frequently and had misplaced my nano card which would hv been v . Inconvenient . your staff got it replaced n connected pretty fast . V professional . Thanks
 The service @ the store was quite efficient and the ambience was gr8. Keep it up .
 I'm very likely & satisfied with ur service
 Just think of very old customer as Reliance is giving extra std n local minutes free also
 Lack of knowledge , even I advised how to send a fine email & executives ask from seniors, so take long time & I do not think that much interested in resolution . Yes but executives are in good numbers At store . I had to be recvd rs 50 as credit but still not . Thanks
 The . Vodafone . Stores . Is . Awesome.... .   U like . It . Very . Much
 No thanks
 It was helpful . The person there was warm .
 This is very disappointed that the store had ten counter but only two guys out there for attending the customer... .
 1.Inexperienced executive 2 pathetic response from customer care 3.no appropriate answer nd solution
 The problems solved instantly, time saving as time is money , good hospitality .
 Firstly, there was no rush: Secondly the staff was cooperative and spontaneous in helping + resolving the problem
 Customer care is not upto the mark . May be less man power .
 I m go to the store twice in a day for sim replacement at durgapuri chowk but no one can solve my problem .
 Good service
 I am satisfied
 t they active with out net pack so your store associate has tell it will not change u go from which store I have bein port
 The request was made earlier , it was effort waste, any way looks like this time taken care .
 It is never 100% anywhere but vodafone is doing well.good job
 It was a hassle free experience
 Good
 I got very good service from lovely and meghna
 ******* * 8 star out of 10 Good service Very good netwark
 GOOD
 Because services is vry good in your store and very helpful employees
 Excellent response in your store starting from security . Pl keep it up .
 They were only two executive. . i have to wait for a long. . and i am using this number since last six months but still there are no good plans for me . Your executive told me for a particular plan(249) about a month ago but still that plan is not applicable for my number .
 The associate was very quick and gave me all the information . He made sure that I understand the procedure . A small room for improvement would be the token announcement system . Instead of the reps shouting out a token number, it would be great if a automatic system would be installed . I visited the hill road Vodafone store . The experience was satisfying and made me feel that I was important .
 Vodafone is awesome in all the ways
 Must improve some more
 Waiting time should be reduced as people are waiting for more than 3 hrs in store to come with his/her token number which is really frustrated.. . and please advice branch manager to talk polite to the customers. .
 Well attention by help desk about my quiry .
 Not satisfied with ans given to us and not proper respose given to question ask by me .
 Good reception and pationtly given reply
 Good
 1. Being a very old company In the business the store is not Upto the mark also just two associates to help when the store is crowded with 10 people . 2.In a technology world of today, paper and pen is still being used instead of automated token machines . 3. The person was good as he was Doing his job as per the company . But it's sad that all I wanted was a change in SIM card from micro to nano and I had to re give the same docs all over again for whichI had waste one hour for my brothers Id papers n signature . Which could have done in 5 mins . By your associate . We are in the 20th century the companyshould update their old policies
 Unnecessary amount deductions made almost every month without any reason. . Its not a valid reason to deduct account from my balance. . So thinking to terminate my service in this network
 Prblm nt solves
 Only oral promises no actual results or delivery . Awful .
 Good interaction,helping behaviour and coperative enviroment
 Experience is good
 Experience with staff is good . But the centre is too cramped . Method of calling out the allotted numbers is primitive - no display of called numbers . Place to sit for customers is inadequate . Cashier arrangement can do with improvement
 Everything is good
 Except for le ving late payment charges for valued customer like me all other services r good
 gr8
 Thanks for all
 Need to improve plans
 Pls dont ask about repeated question related to service it was best...10 out 0f 100...but rplt me about my network problem call drop ...vodafone is lossing the quality of network
 Firstly there were too many customers and the staff to attend them was insufficient . It took around 2 hours waiting time and even after that the staff was not at all coperative . They firstly do not tell clearly which all documents do they require and it leads to problems of visinting the store again and again .
 Store provide me complete knowledge of problem and give me all informatino about my plans
 Misguide to customers regarding before outstanding bills . Every executive answes are different .
 The reason I visited store was fully sc
 Because he didn't refused to take the genuine action but I would like you to never add any amount in the bill which is not genuine
 Overall it was very smooth experience and concerning executive was very cooperative .
 Timely and point to point correct response. .
 Well have a great feeling at the outlet, solving all my query without any hazel .
 No problems were faced as on date .
 Good communication skills of staff on duty anf interest to answt the queries of customer
 VERY CO OPERATIV
 I am not getting the solution of the problem . So I am going to disconnect my number
 Very great experience... . The agent was very helpful & store was well organised.. . .
 Whenever I came to your store I always find the right answer for my problems
 No Assistance been provided for corporate plan inspite of waiting for 2 hours
 Executive was not able to solve issue wasted my 2 hours
 There should be many improvmnts in vodafone because when we call on vodafone no its takes time n we rarely get response. .
 They understood the prb and responded quickly and did everything they could to resolve my problem
 Very helping nature and provide me complete knowledge of my plan
 Customer care executive was extremely courteous and helpful .
 There is no proper reception can't speak properly but no 1 has visited our site to solve the problem everyday they say tomorow but no 1 has come yet
 There a person name Vicky daswani attend me very gud ... .
 My Problem is not yet resolved
 0/10
 Service is very slow
 SIM not started yet .
 Voice clearty is not good
 Without knowing customer you on and off the services and even after 48 hrs of the complaint raised you are not bother to resolve it .
 Service is good
 10 out 10
 Yes
 Overall all good .
 I've faced the 3G connection failure several times over the last few wks, hence the need to visit the store as help given on phone lasted a day or two
 My issues were resolved effectively
 Unresponsive behave
 good and quick response and good knowledge love the way she resolved the issues
 Any office or like your store staff should be attend such minimum respect with their customers . It's my personal experience My Name: P.G.Kumar, age: 60 Thanks
 Nice work
 Interaction n experience in Vodafone store was good ... .
 My problem of Rom like home of 9819949127 & 9819934591 both my no is stil not activated pl do needful
 Susheela who attended to my request was calm and never did she frustrated cos she answered patiently and helped with my issues and requests . There were requests that I added one after another . And she knew everything and answered with ease . I cut 1 point cos the ambience could be better of the store
 Your representative firstly gave incorrect information and asked us to come back in hour saying, he will keep the sim ready . He also didn't call as he promised . We went back to find the store closing, and he found out then, more documents are required for duplicate sim . Being a little proactive, he couldhave saved so much time and huddle for me and himself
 Emmidiate service and response
 Exsilent
 The store associate tried to understand my problem and provided the best solution . He was also quite courteous .
 Need some more VF Stores in som locations ,it might avoid WAITING in queue .
 Everything is fine and waiting time is also less . Thumbs up

 From postpaid to prepaid connection told me that , i will get disc only when billing take place and will not get money back, non cooperative attitude . Will never take vodafone postpaid connection
 I am not happy with my last experience which I visited in same store 3-4 months ago . However, in today's visit the lady corrected previous mistake but could be more polite .
 Had my issue successfully resolved without much hassle
 Helpful understand customer need

 Staff kept busyvwith other activities unrelated to Vodafone .
 There is a lot of Network issue in sec 5 gurgaon from past 6 months . I am using 3 vodafone postpaid connections but now I think I need to switch to someother network .
 It was good. .
 y the bill to release barred services . Visited store, same reply . I did have my due date till next month 8th . I have been using Vodafone for a long timenow n finally because of ur wonderful service I have decided to move all my 15 CUG connections to some other better service provider who can understand the customers need n take action immediately without making the customer irritated .
 Very good
 nsidering to port to airtel .
 Network issues persist . Kindly check .
 Associate doesn't have the professional approach and due to which i did not get the resolution of my problem, so wanting to change the services as beinga 10 year old customer, not expected such kind of services from a reputed company .
 Despite being a regular pay master they made me wait without telling me the reason . They did not answer any of my questions with grace and attention .
 Am using Vodaphone post paid service past 1 year , why you need deposit ? If you don't believe on me
 The information from mini store and the main stores are not the same
 Very good
 Needs a lot of customer service improvement . When it was Max touch or Hutchinson Max . had a wonderful experience .
 Customer executive are very good . ...speaking . ...specially one mister AbilAsh . .......solve my problm suddenly.....thanks ...to alll

 Good Service Provide.. .
 If a customer gets a service like this who is a regular payer of the bills tell me who is going to be happy . Since three months I faced the problem twice i.e without any notification they barred my outgoing calls .
 then what's the point of going to the store . My experience was not good .
 please provide the training to how to deactivate corporate plan and other stuff to ur employees . Good bye for vodafone forever... .
 Ms Sadhana ur Associate explained well my querry
 They understood my query imm & given assurance to solve within next few days . They took hardly 5 mnts to conclude the query .
 Your executive was very co operative & solve my query promptly -Dr. Samir
 I didn't had to wait . My problem was addressed immediately and was resolved well . Behaviour of staff was also appreciable .
 Thanks
 Its long story - technical/professional . customer service could be made available direct on mobile to save time/travel to ut gallery
 Network is very bad . Not happy with 3g services at all .
 I was not given a proper and satisfactory reply .
 How about no ?xD xD
 The lady was very helpful a
 Nice experience with vodafone
 Bad. . Very bad
 Good service
 Your person don't have any knowledge. . If they are attending some one then he should solve his problem or if he can't then he should ask his senior .
 The service was good and i appreciate trupti's effort.She was very kind and helpfull . Cheers
 were saying to port on other network..Asking mentally harrasing questions..questioning on dignity to 8 year old customer .
 Service was very unprofessional . Customer's sentiments were sent for a toss . Informations were not shared openly .
 Its nice .
 More professionalism required .
 There is no need to say good morning loudly by watch man . It scared me . Must have waiting room or place to seats . No help for corporate user (cug) regarding vodafone red or any assistance .
 Experience is no different from that of other telcos - call centre experience was very very poor
 1.You Coudnt Solve All For What I Visted . 2.Your Fault Is Being Imposed On Me To Pay Seperately Which I Was Supposed To Get Free Under Plan.3.I Paid MoreBefore Time Doesnt Mean You Add Free Net Usage In My Bill,making Me To Think To Stop The No With Other 12 Nos Also .
 It took long time to port to Vodafone about more than 15 days . Promised 3G net pack is still not activated although promised in the package .
 I am very loyal custmer of vodafone and i m very dissappointed with ur interactions and services . But if vodafone cannot solve my simple problem I will
 Service was quite good .
 Very friendly and supportive staff
 Too much delay in attending customer
 Staff should be more efficient, have a smiling face and above all COURTEOUS.
 She Solve my problem in a quick session . Explain the benefits to keep my mind to stay with vodafone . Over all having a very nice experience
 I am very happy with the service
 viders example reliance . 3g
 The person that dealt with my request was knowledgeable and efficient .
 Very bad experience
 Vodafone is a cheating company with incompetent, arrogent and confused staff .
 I am a corporate olan user.i wanted to transfer the ownership of my number to my son,who also us a corporate user . I was told that this transfer of ownership is lenghty n has a charge . Thus was my only.discomfort as i didnt understand the logic n reason behind the money being charged fr the activity .
 I want my gift I m postpaid customer.I will switch my service to other network
 By giving fake details your executive cheated me . regarding this store manager also failed to solve my problem hence i decided to raise a complaint in co
 Executive gave 100% information about all queries
 I'm using Vodafone since I was studying in 10th std and even after marriage I'm still continuing with same network I love the network n service all over india
 each other no one came forward to help us instantly we have to wait around 5 to 7 minutes even in an empty store .
 best service I feel :)
 Internet speed is very slow I don't like Vodafone Internet speed
 My corporate plan was changed without my consent and rental increased
 Your store is very suffocating and doesn't have enough space for customer to stand . While having big lineup your store associate are talking to each other and that looks like that they all are ******* their time and we fools(customer) have all time in the world to waste .
 Your executive Mr Saleem was too polite and helpful . I'm really glad to be a part of Vodafone family . Regards Anurag Sharma
 I have nice experience with vodafone
 I went to Prabhadevi store this morning to get sim replacement . The reason for the same can be found on my profile . There was a girl with red tshirt on,I guess she was a supervisor but not the manager . She was on walk in desk . When I asked her about the replacement she simply ask me to unlock my phone . Then she checked settings and everything was in proper place . Then she restarted the phone without even asking me . Then she use Internet which worked finethen . So I told her sometime it works and sometime not . Simply she ask me to take token and go to customer care agent to report network issue . She not even asked me for my number to check on the system . She was very rude in her behaviour towards other customers as well . I don't think she is a right candidate to be in that position . Thank you
 Advisors at store have no knowledge of products and services and very bad attitude towards customer .
 Main reason is process and system I liked it
 I have requested for a plan change on 16 October 2014 at your outlet in cannought place.. . But unfortunately despite repeated visits and timely submissioe way to treat the customers...n of the required documents . The plan has not been changed yet .

 Going to vodafone store is very time consuming It took me arround 2 hours just to replace my sim, thier is only one customer service executive is available to attend, every time we need to spend to much time to slove our small glitch

 er who assisted me, Mr anirban, appears warm and well behaved and knows his job well . Good interaction skill .

 Less customer care executive to attend many customer No sense of responsibility Not much bother about customer problems
 Dull response towards packages new scheme, poor response towards sim card data response .
 Work done was very fast And the team was very supportive
 Why you open Mini Store in Fort Songadh, while no one give reply even simple question . The man you have appointed is still absence due any reason . So Ithat Vodafone do like datfeel u also appoint me for such good designation and I rake salary from you and work for another firm duty.. . This is very disgusting . ..  I m sorry for
 Terrible service at the store . Wait times are very high despite no customers around.Service staff was spending time talking to each other away from the desk rather than expediting customer service .
 Dear host I haven't yet got the confirmation of my tarrif changes through texts ! I'm confused whether to start using my newly subscribed internet or not .
 I have seen in past, requests are not fulfilled sometimes which causes to loose trust in Vodafone . It should be looked after
 the over all was good but the employee according to me should be more open and show interest to the ccustomer
 Not able to reach customer care . Some option which we require n missing
 What's the use of a plush store nd a couple of nicely dressed and sweetly talking associates when the Vodafone network is getting worser by the day ?
 She is very helpful.. .
 Pleasant way of handling customer .
 The store person giving service as burden on him .
 na
 It was nice talking to your employee & listening my issue carefully & provide right solution & also speak very politely thatswhy I'm giving 10 rating .
 5 counters and two desks but only 2 people on the counter.Rude staff.The rest in cabin busy with their phones?Why?I feal they r paid to work?Not 2 sit inthe cabin & busy with their phones ?
 I took a prepaid sim card & i was told that it can be activated in 2 hours . However i could not activate it today . When i called customer service i was told it will take 72 hours to activate it

 There was no proper response when i cald d customer care . This made me approach the stores . Customer care service should have been bettr! !
 Quick service and helpful prsnaltey
 Very nice service
 The token system is taking much time which is causing time problems. .
 They were working very slow .
 Over all good , as you need some documents photo copy , you sold have a copying machine at your store
 We are very Satisfied form your newtwork
 Good services . Only unhappy with the small fact that even for a sim change I had to submit documentation when all my data was easily available on screen.Overall experience has been wonderful
 The person attending me was prompt and proper but around her there was no other support system : for taking token or guiding the traffic
 Prompt Solutions
 The problem was sorted out at the earliest

 My recent experience is good with compare earlier visited on Vodafone store located in sapna sangeta road Indore (M.P) Thank you
 Vodafone doesn't have procedure which clearly mentioned on exactly what decision Vodafone executive have . Also they have open loop ***** in payments processing in bill desk as after payments also they are unable to track it . The email communications is saved in customers profile without attachments whichare helpful to resolve issues . Store doesn't have time frame in which any customers will be attended by Vodafone assocites .
 Customer friendly . Excellent service i feel so happy thanks maheshkumar .
 Your helping service very bad.i am fully disatisfy with vodafone. .
 Experience
 I went to the centre,the people were helpful.but sadly i would like to state that my problem has still not been sorted out
 Extended service quality by the associate . He had been outstanding resolving the queries . Cheers
 Worst service being provided . No commitment to statements and it changes with person I talk to . Would not recommend anyone definitely .
 Would appreciate if the AC in the story is working and the there is less waiting time
 Keep up the good work . Please address network complaints promptly
 sorry

 Its fine
 aapke customer care ya office executive koi thik se reply nahi deta un logo ko mera problem samjata he par koi solutions nahi deta
 Very stisfied visiting for Vodafone store
 Very Good
 I was unsatisfied when i wanted postpaid to prepaid of my number cause of facing lots of problem till i couldn't prepaid to my number . I didn't know whyit was happen . Really i feel very sad for that .
 Since from last 15 days I have visited your store 3 times to activate 1GB 3G service on my number but it is not activated till yet .
 The benefits that i was promised before taking the connection is now not active . Vodafone store guys say that it was a wrongly committed benefit from vodafone store executive, and it would not be active now . This is a fraud done by u guys with me and will soon register a case with consumer court now .
 People are good and supporting but,I have a problem that when we ask than only we get some benefits,instead of that, they should have intimated the benefits to the customers . Overall it was near to satisfaction .
 I was very disappointed with the product offerings but i felt i should not penalise the representatizes
 M really happy with vodafone worlds reachest networkm bur m not satiesfied with blackberry vodafone plans
 I met inexperienced person . Else everything was good.Thanx . Pankaj Shah
 Overall experience at Vodafone was great ..
 Best regards . ..gud customer in traction associates are gud response in every customer . ..
 Been very helpful. .
 Prompt & desired delivery
 Very friendly and organized service . Thank you .
 The associate said where the outlet u have got the SIM u have to go there only
 Very arrogant behaviour . No proper response
 Yes
 I was much satisfied with d representative
 Obediant, sincere to help customers with smiling face .
 Well informed
 My previous month paper bill is still undelivered and no action on that . Rest all was good and store associate was ok .
 Interaction with customer is rude .
 There are lot of work u have to do with your communication gap between the Vodafone store and customer care executive . Because many things which are telling to customers by c.c.e . nd Vodafone Mobile store executive sometimes not correlates about services and problem dealing .
 ******** experience
 My email not working since last 45 days, i called many times in your call centre but no positive action also i visited your liberty garden, malad store 2times but still no corrective action so i am not satisfy .
 I raised a complaint there that I recharged with Rs 29 twice which is a rate cutter plan . Both the times i received confirmation message that recharge has been done but I didn't get the services . That recharge didn't get activated on my number . So, I asked for refund . After i reached home, I got a call from vodafone and they admitted every their fault still they refused to refund my money back . Worst services ever provided by Vodafone . I am switching to Airtel now .
 Excellent knowledge vodafone employe and awsome services
 Super service given by panvel gallery
 THANKS FOR YOUR QUICK REACTION AND CO-OPERATION
 Satisfied with the service
 Evrythng was ok
 There has been no response from Store Associates when I contact them over phone . Therefore, I had to make a visit to the store . Also, I would like to sug
 Room to improve lot .
 Number takes forevermore activate Staff don't know how to help Staff don't send forms Staff are rude
 THE ATTENDENTS WERE NOT FOLLOWING TOKEN ORDERS, I HAD TO STAND BESIDE THE ATTENDENT AND ASK HIM TO ATTEND ME. OTHERWISE IT WAS GOOD
 Had to wait too long, even when the counters were available, systems were not working, the staff was rude and did not trust my complaint at first, had toshow them the proof of SMS by Vodafone to prove what I was saying was not baseless .
 Very good
 Garuda is better than your service. .
 Till now sevice is soo good . one thing I want to convey, the callers tones should be the original song . Now my caller tone is not the original song, itssung by some other artist which don't have the feel as the original song
 1) Poor knowledge of service representatives about plans availability and offering them to customer with pros & cons 2) Slow service 3) Even with token based queue, customers being served out of order 4) Not much place for waiting, crowded environment
 no specific complaints....however you can still launch more 3g economic packs in accordance to the market conditions to invte more customers tks rajesh
 Finally i want to say two words , superb customer care centre.in indore
 Always Remember Krishna Never Forget Krishna Doing Our Duty Very Sinseriously With Faith Lord Can Give Blessings For All So Do Nice Service God Bless You, 10
 Already mentioned in above comments ... . nothing more to add .
 it for Vodafone to make amends for their failures
 iculous .
 Issue was understood properly and required data and detail analysis was provided which was unsuccessful during telephonic discussion .
 Service by mr.VITTHAL
 Typed 0 by mistake instead of 9
 Very poor queue management; took me 3 visits to know that nano sim is not there for pre paid
 I visited the store to get a nano sim for my existing number. . The token number given to me was 235 and i was assigned counter A.. But the staff at counter A was busy with someone else while it was my turn. . So i had to go to another counter after 5 minutes. . I spoke to a staff member regarding the nano sim . He entered my number into the system and told me that the servers haven't updated my information and that it would take 1 or 2days to update my info. . I was shocked to hear that. . It was the fault of vodafone on updating my information. . The customer shouldn't be kept on the loop lile this .
 Wrong information given to me . Immediate solution was not given . Wrong charges has been made . Happy with the representative but nor happy with Vodafone .
 Good
 Respnce time was good reasolved all quries hope will enjoy the Vodafone servies in future
 Vodafone is a good network for me .
 1st giv the proper training to vodofne excutives. . Only few people knw the customer needs and understanding....and pls share the escalation matrix to customer..pls free to call me i ll xplain more
 good store
 customer.. .
 My num was barred bec i did not pay the bill bec some extra charges exec understood & resolve the same .
 Its not bad
 Good networking . Best call rates . Super data offers.excited every day with you Vodafone . Increase net speed . Long live Vodafone . Keep giving me best offe
 There is no proper technical skills with the staff
 All is good
 Token system is good , office ambiance is good, executive's assistance was good . Hence, rated 10.
 The perspn attended me was very proactive co operatve & through in his job .
 Fast response to every complaint.. . Clean and musical environment. . Everything was great
 Because every time I go overseas the phone stops working
 Overall satisfied...expecting more internet offers for prepaid regular customers
 nter tells me I am not a recognised customer of Vodafone . She tried to make me a new customer and told me it would take five days to get s SIM card . In fSince I got myself an iPhone 6, I wanted to upgrade to a nano sim . I took the necessary documents and asked for a sim at the store . The damsel at the couact I am the oldest customer of Vodafone at Vasco . I have the number for over 10 years now when it was BPL. Just because I persisted, I got my nano sim quickly . I don't think I would recommend Vodafone in the future at this rate .
 I like ur services . .
 The service that given by the center is well served
 Bcoz prompt attention was given to my query and resolved .
 All is ok .
 Singh telecom mini store is very smartly & Quick Work
 the bill
 Really superb i am very satisfied
 From lastnifht my inyernet conectuon cant get
 It was very poorly handled I am referring to customer support
 Zafar the gentleman who attended to me patiently heard me out to understand my needs then gave me the options available . This helped me decide then afterasking further details proceeded to implement my choice, he was patient, considerate and efficient . Zafar talks less and is result oriented .
 I feel u r not customer friendly . Actually my cousin brother has gone out for this country . His corporate connection sim is given to me to use . Now I want to get it transferred to my name and he I ready to do so . But v could not get to know the procedure
 Take care of ur customers with pure and accurate service don't give them unnecessary bill .
 Y
 Very helping & good nature of people at store, I really feel good and satisfied
 Awesome
 You have a very pathetic cash machine...i have added 2 , 500 notes and your machine didn't gave back the change...now I have to wait for 2 months for same amount
 Very bad customer service
 I had a problem with my sim card-no network access . Problem resolved by staff by making some changes on the phone . No details provided in spite of requesting . Second request for procedure to activate international roaming and related details were not answered clearly
 People there in store are least bothered attending client . Instead they are bsy gossiping and laughing .
 Thank u
 It was good experience to me by getting good knowledge on buying Vodafone broadband connection . And the person told very frankly .
 Good understanding of problem statement and quick resolution .
 Rude behaviour high handedness where is your happy to help!! !
 Friendly nature, good dealing
 I love being with vodafone and I enjoy the service offered to their customers
 Your associates are too cooperatiue .
 Good servive helpful ppl
 Polite,patiance&promptness of person
 I've been customer of urs for 10yrs . I've never seen such a quick resolution of the query i made . My problem was solved asap. .
 Regard . Asif shaikh
 Staff @ Vodafone store Jabalpur is very cooperative :-)
 Staff is good with best attention ,but waiting sitting arrangement not available in ur this store.hence totally good .
 So-so experience . Staff busy doing other things rather than attendind customer standing in the store .
 Irresponsible, arrogant, negligent, lazy, egoistic, Unprofessional, non disciplined.,,,,,,,, All good qualities as above & many more
 Very cooperative and nicely communicated with me, solved my problem
 Over all good experience
 Ok, see, I visited ur Vodafone store to get an information regarding mpesa, and the information I got from them was totally wrong, and I got the correctinformation from the customer care, so what is the use of them sitting there .
 They interact in a very happy mood, asked my requirements and suggested what I have to do . Nice support :)
 Very helpful.exited for the gift .
 Your place is cramped with no proper facilities for even standing, let alone sitting and your staff is doing such a good job in such difficult environment it is to be appreciated
 Good work and service
 they are not aware of privacy and information security related topics ! They were insisting on copy of pan card with the pan number !
 Well the service is good..every one there in vodafone stores were happy to help us...i am very much suprized with service.. .
 Network problem of call barring still not solved
 I am paying money for 3G net but i am not getting the service
 C charges went 45 from 35 now .
 You have unnecessarily charged me for nothing and your staff has no answer to give and explain . Pathetic experience
 Systematic and organised service centre ...tks
 No words to say abt ur service center
 Very good having with me and store having good instructor,nice insfastacture .
 I am using vodafone more than 12years and presently i have 3 connections.since i have no network connections problem it's better to use ur network .
 Your RS puram people are not picking the phone atall.irresponsble people .
 laints given by customers , also in store , customers have to force the associates to take complaint , if this is solved , customers will be happy
 A very homely atmosphere
 Very like .
 Good

 Call Me On weekdays between 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm . Thanks
 Desired preference was not given to senior citizen like me . I had to wait for over 40 minutes for service to be given to me .
 Staff is co oprative . Willing to help .
 So Good
 Soft dealing&pleasing facial expressions .
 Vodafone is good
 Just one thing .. . Vodafone family its like if there is any Customer coming to the store great him.with a small less expensive gift which Vodafone can make a good feeling and which will or can give you one more Customer to make him.happy. . Warm regards Nikhil sales manager

 Ans 3: 3
 Every thing was good
 Its gud
 Satisfied wit ovrall service at the store n also satisfied wit mobile service
 Behaviour was rude and querry was not resolved
 The staff were interested only in new connections . We old customers were not valuable any more . That was the feeling that I had .
 You're relationship manager Mr. Rajkumar did an excellent job
 Appreciable job
 I went to koramangal outlet one week back to disconnect the number or change in to prepaid 9986000722 Service was bad she told me to come on 20th WhenI went yesterday at indiranagar next staff said me to come on Monday I will get it done This is what customers should do going Vodafone store all way's .
 Response at store was good but when called on 111 no clear status of request pending is given
 Very supportive..excellent service . ..Thanks for help and support from your executive .
 Nice coversation good communication skills
 The store associate is not able to understand the bill
 Everything was just good
 Good service
 Not properly trained to resolve the issue...no knowlege of settings
 Good experience .

 Bhosadyanoo.. .
 Excellent way of talking .

 I visited kakurgachi shop the person was very caring and helped me a lot
 Apprecited the svc and promptness
 n. But after repeated calls to customer service couldnt get any answer for 6 hours.needed to vsit store again nd found out tht sim denoted to me was wrong nd they replaced sim . Over all had a horrible exp . Of store as well as customer serviceI wanted to change frm post paid to pre paid nd visited store for d same . I was told it wil b taking around 2 hours for services to resume after migratio
 More time taken for implemting instructions
 Explanation of the bill was not done properly and was directed to the coroprate office . Waste of time .
 ch is been changed to 699
 People were not told to wait for their turn according to token number..rest was all fine. .
 very friendly atmosphere ..... .
 My problem was attended quickly and the dealing person was well informed .
 There is no good service from Vodafone executive's
 I was abused (called son of bitch, an irritating person, a liar because they believed I had deliberately taken a number and not paid bill on purpose) . The manager Rafat bluntly told me "apna kaam karaiye aur bahar jaaiye yahan se . Humein koi shauk nahi hai aapki kahani sunne ka" . Some Irshad guy completely lost it and started throwing things! ! He even tried to punch me but his fellow employees forcefully took him away to back room! ! Man it was harassmentat its peak ! Terrible ! :- (
 Ur sytem of hearing complaints is excellent . Ur employees r also well trained n give suitable reply
 i feel mr . gaurav is very careful about customer
 Since from my association this time only i found right & verry responisble nd attentive head .
 The problem for which I visited the store is still not solved . I dont get signal in my mobile Message sending fails frequently and takes 2 mins to send Akways R is visible over the signal strength Even though I have opted for 3G net is very slow People say my phone is not reachable These are som reasons Ifeel I should change to Airtel
 Very fast resolution provide by executive
 indifferent & rude attitude . very frustrating experience
 Really appreciate the service rendered by the customer assistance but there was no token system they were calling manualy and waiting time was too lengthy .
 An executive of ur garia store didnt understand my problem,and without consult with me he'll create another prblm 4 my connection thats why I had 2 leftthat store .
 Good person
 Amazing exprnc of cstmr srvc
 Very bad services not even make payment on time

 No response on network drop issue
 None of the staff was knowing which sim was to be used in the phone .
 The store associate was very interactive and keen on helping .
 Plzzz make the solution fast
 Nobody know about Caller tune, wasted my 1 hour , totally disappointed
 10 (very satisfied)
 Store ambiance was good they offered me a cup of tea and replayed all my quires so overall I will give 8.5 out of 10
 After meeting and seeing bad behavior of your staff at gallery and call center .
 Excellent

 Team has responded quickly & appropriately for my queries . Thanks for thy the support .
 Yes
 The response of the staff was very good
 Very Bad..going to disconnect my postpaid soon. .
 Your Vodafone cash payment machine is really good . Payment updated on time .
 It took almost 2 hours to get a simple answer.appauling services
 behaved very rudely . Since last 7 long years am your valuable client using 2 post paid connections and you people always think that you and your company
 The 3G activation doers work on my phone . My phone says No Internet . At least I had 2g earlier .
 At store good response but over call and email not satisfactory wrong data provided .
 Overall satisfactory experience .
 Phatic services
 Good service good voda

 Your service is very bad & poor
 It's fine
 I 100 % satify but need more improment
 Good and nice experience .
 Your representative Mr. Avik Sen at Saltlake City Center-I Vodafone Stores behaviour & Manner is too much rood .
 i felt very good and my work got fineshed easyly and i am thankful for vodafone
 Its usefull you all know all the issues stop this rubbish feedback . talking about 3G and stupid call dropping
 Shravan Is The Best Person In The Store .... .
 The guy was helping nature just bcz of him i m giving this rating
 I am not satisfied with the postpaid plan for my usage in comparison to other operators, thinking to switch .. .
 Never understand the billing ...your call centre never respond on time .. . :(
 Good
 I still yet to know the feed back of my request .
 They themselves are so confused.my internet wasn't working,I visited the Vodafone care twice but they were unable to solve my problem .. .
 It was awesome

 It was a good experience to use vodafone service as there was least inconveniences .
 Frindly staff
 No option to talk to a person on phone support (121).
 First time excelent service
 Customer should be treated even better so that he may continue with the network even thou network is poor in many areas of city,
 Very good service from gurpreet
 I am experiencing fraud from your side . I have been told one plan, and in actual given another plan . And your executive not able to help me .
 Vodafone is best in all company and satisfy to your customer very well
 They are not taken to customers seriously
 Service is speddy nd good
 No satisfaktion
 Your executive did not resolve my query . I want to change my no into prepaid . Now i am thinking to change operator .
 just for formality they are attending customer.i called customer for my problem they ask to send message or visit store.but no solution still now .
 Plz your sales persons are not at all trustful because they run away by taking money in advance for security deposit.I lost my Rs 500
 Staff need attention training to act excellent
 No comments please
 Very few customer care executive, very slow processing of request, more than 80 minutes of waiting time, and poor knowledge/understanding of rules in executive
 Hello, my experience is very very good in vodafone store,

 Not a single thing is avilable over their i was wishing to get my prepaid sim back but you guys forced me to buy post paid
 Amazing customer service, keep it up ! A satisfied and proud Vodafone Customer :-)
 I have transfer my name old Veer sales to my self.problem is they r not agree to continue my running plan.issue is this .
 Service was not upto the mark .. . the way it should be.. .

 Im not getting internet setting still now.. .
 ashes I suggest a seperate desk for priority customers Thanks
 I am satisfied wirh service of vodafoe staff .

 First apke imploys ko noleg nai h second bat krne ka tarika nai h
 Can b better
 Your staff is very helpful and courteous . They have full respect for senior citizens . Thanks for the caring service . Sheroo .
 Even after I had paid Rs 600 to have my sim kept for safe keeping, bills were still being generated . I had the receipt to show that I had made the payment, also had the email detailing how I had asked for the sim to be kept for safe keeping, yet I had to wait for three days before the charges could be waived . And they were waived because I raised my voice at the customer centre, and not because your staff realized their mistake . And even now, the plans that I had activated earlier seem to have been deactivated . Going to switch to another carrier pretty soon . Pathetic service .
 Not satisfied for the 4 th time
 I Dont understand why the attendents at vodafone store charge rs . 100 For issuing a new sim card for d same no .
 After the 1 n half month my problem is steel not solved yet . Tell me what can I do ?
 Informative, convincing and interesting
 Because it is a good company and provide good services .
 THERE SHALL BE PRIORITY GIVEN TO POSTPAID CUSTOMERS. THERE SHALL SEPRATE TOKENS FOR POSTPAID CUSTOMERS.
 I was attended promptly and gave correct information and advice .
 Thanku
 Very user friendly
 Please do my work .

 The associate was very polite n helped out in resolving the task
 Token system was getting bypassed by others and Ni one was speaking anything. . Also, no one was there at the bill payment desk for long time and I had toask everyone for that. .
 Sanjib is 2 good in that store
 (1/2) On 21st October I visited your store at Himayathnagar and made specific request for disabling data pack of 99, restore my plan for advance rental payment,(2/2) stop charging for internet . The executive who attended me to do needful . I also received a call from customer care to this effect . But nothing done till
 I visited vodaphone centre basaveswarnagar and they gave me new simcard . I waited for 5 days and again I visited vodaphone centre sahakarnagar and finally with great difficulty It was activated .
 Friendly Understandable
 Very good
 It was gud.. . The executive is very gud and explane me every thing and guide me for what I am facing.. . But Vodafone network problem is disaster that shecan't help me.. . She following for my complaint but not Abel to solve that problem.. . We are using corporate connection
 It was great experience
 Very gudd service from suradhikrishnan
 Patience to answer my queries

 ected .
 I am not satisfy ur service from last year till now i deposite minimum 1000 rs bill . Finally i decided i will take airtel postpaid pala . Because u have lot of attitude
 Store operator isn't very professional in dealing with clients .
 Only 2 counters were operating out of 5 and the executives were calling the tokens randomly... .
 Untainted
 The way they are treating is not at all good . No proper response .
 Vodafone cheating customers . Will move to other network very soon
 The overall ex
 Your executive are waste of time, they have no courtesy, they are lier, waste of time and not a solution provider . You should close your stores or should

 Good ecprrience anf services
 The executive had nothing to offer as a solution to my concerns . He just kept repeating what was available to him on screen . No solution provided
 Nice behavior and good dealing
 I Am working in chennai , My native is villupuram i took my sim in my native only . I am using this sim more than 8 years . Now i would convert the sim postpaid to prepaid , i went to villupuram store but they didnt reply properly . They are asking me what should we do like some unnecessary reasons . Seriously i dont like this type of response from your good name of vodafone . Please take necessary action .
 Your service is not good
 I have visited the vodafone store thrice for just one purpose- inflated postpaid bill.. . I paid it twice but not the third time.. . I thank Narayan sir for waiving off the bill this time .
 In a single visit any work does not complete . Commitment level is zero.service is poor . This is not that service which was in 8 years back . Either improve the service or be ready for a heavy customer loss .
 Satisfactory.. .
 Lack of complete information,,
 Process complicated . E.g . passport is necessary . Need to confirm to,company, etc . No flexibility .
 The Service Was Quick And Upto The Mark
 1. For the same issue I was made to visit the store multiple times and the issue is still not resolved . 2. More than 2 hours waiting time at the store.3. Custmer care rep did not honor their assurance . 4. the discussion was not recorded completely on the system for future reference . 5. i am still not sure that my issue is being resolved . 6. last but not least, being a valuable custmer for over 6 years i am now forced to quit and take the pain to quit my mobile no . if my complaint is not resolved .
 Farmer
 According to vodafone connection is a big loss high call charge no good offers no free internet packs aa big loss i thing to port this connection
 Yes very satisfid
 Great

 VERY SATISFIED
 The treatment what I had received was very cool nd optimistic . The showroom assistant who handled my issues very carefully nd her repeated calls help me to rectify my very rapidly .
 The lead time was very less for solving my problem . I would be happy when the waiver will be credited. .

 The service is prompt and with smile .
 i have given rating according to behavior knowledge response...... . these all things were quite ok but dealling problem can't speak a single word
 Good experience
 There is no place for sitting .
 My experience is very good I am very satisfied.. .
 Rude Behavier . No Complaint Handled
 My problem is not resolved . I am not provided with any tracking id or no . For my complaint . The behavior of associate was misleading . I am extremely disa
 It's nice network
 I wanted replacement simon card which you took money for but when I wanted email settings for my phone nobody was ready to help me in the store they saidthere is only one person who know it and he is on break so un professional the rep said he will come in half hr you don't trained people for everything
 internet is Very bad network very fast port this vodafone
 Mana kaha tha na
 The dealing executive was v
 Some employees were doing time pass and i was waiting for them to attend me
 Ur P.R.o people r not takeing care and not take ing any responce to the people who r visiting to them with thair problums
 Good
 Everything from staff interaction, behaviour, willingness and inclination to help was absolutely missing . Had to wait for almost an hr to get my simple query resolved . There was a blank PRIORITY counter through out . Better service is available fr
 Support was very friendly and got 100% solution
 Store ambience is pretty good, process followed is excellent but executives facing the customer should be in a service mood, not in a serious mood .
 Shoteg of sttaf. . No sit ofering.. . Waitng for more time .
 What I needed was quickly taken care of . Store Associate was good and sincerely attended my request .
 I got a 3g data pac, but getting 2g speed since 18.12.2014. I did not get any solution from customer care re this . They only said I need to wait untill 2
 Excellent
 I could see a customer friendly approach there . But i haven't received the final outcome of my complaint yet .
 Quick and easy, got the info I needed .
 Pls resolve network problem
 Callous behaviour of officials . Loss of documents by them, which were submitted on 14/11/14 to change ownership . Rude way of talking to me . Before finishing my request, the official took other customers and kept me waiting on one pretext or the other . Did not listen to my complaints too .
 The service provided to me was really satisfying .
 Vodafone has charged me rs 850 for using 230 mb net extra from my package so i am porting to airtel .
 Everything good .
 Never thought it will be so quick & hassle free . Happy with the courtesy & responsiveness of Representative .
 The way of explaining was good and clear
 As I said earlier the service is outstanding but man management is very poor . I am talking about Girish perk Vodafone store . Though there is 8 counters,but barely 2 or 3 counters were working yesterday . As a result there was a long Que . Need to take care this . Otherwise fine .
 My complaint is some messages displayed on wall and distrubing me during calls . They said ok now onwards those will not come . I am happy and came to my home . Again start that bludy messages disturbing . I have no time to go to service centre again . Pls understand

 Nice
 NY problem was not solved although the stir associate temporarily solved it
 Need more experienced person to handle the customers .
 Sexy
 I gave a request for changing my connection from postpaid to prepaid on 18th . I still haven't got any request number or any calls from vodafone stating the same.Im leaving for US this 23rd and I appreciate vodafone looking into this issue .
 Good service
 Prepaid micro sim is not available in the store(kamla Nagar,Agra) from last 14 days .
 Service was good . prompt response .
 The executive was not paying attention to me . I got the feeling to get out of the store actually
 It was done quickly and the staff wss helpful
 Pls improve ur internet and calls visibility service which had drop in particular area where people have start migrating to airtel also seems that u arenot bothered to look into our problems
 Given proper information
 They understand my problem and solved it . Great team
 The company executive must be polite and gentle to handle each and every customer to attend ,solve their problems .
 Pathetic services
 Yesterday I asked for 2gb 199 plan and I guess it is not activated yet .
 ey explained me 499 plan with good features. . but in real the 499 plan is totally different from the one they explained to me. . I am not satisfied. .
 I want change my sim card i was visited your store but no solution
 Fine
 vodafone service always good .
 Customer approach was overall good . Instant access to the customer problem .
 More counters during offer time. .
 Do not send unwanted service msg from ur co thanks .
 Gud service! !
 Store Associate did not know how to talk & behave with customer .
 I m in roaming...so help me
 Immediate service, almost equal consideration to all type of customers .
 Nice support
 Best Suited plan provided
 Your counter executive Sourav is incompetent to handle customers . He misbehaved with me . A customer may anger due to his desatisfaction but the counter person should not .
 The process of portability was completed in just one visit . The show room had a camera to take a photo of self to complete the documentation process . Quick and attentive service was we'll appreciated
 Pl call later 2day if u are serious about finding out that . If u are really serious u will take the trouble to call, else i shall believe that this PR exercise of yours is nothing but a big sham .
 Your associate didnot told me about all the plans that would benefit me . For all the details i had to surf your site . Rest of my experience was good .
 My number was put on hold in Jan 14, when I returned to Nigeria . Prior to that, I visited your store & got details of how to put the phone on hold to Dec . this year . I did as instructed, deposited money, sent email with scanned receipts etc requesting hold . However, billing continued and Vodaphone staff began harassing my family here for payment which was not due ! It seems resolved now, but the experience is unforgettable .
 Overall good service keep it up
 Tel your service executive be humble
 i am extremily happy of ur service
 Pankaj
 Customers caring and quick response to query

 urjeet helped me . Though it'll take 3days but at least my problem . Very bad experience
 My problem was not solved . The complaint I raises was closed without my consent n resolution . Lost inr 1200 aprox in credit balance
 Too cluttered ambience . Associates were busy talking on phone and amongst themselves .
 Your service person, Jatin, was very helpful . However your 3G service does not work effectively in any state of Northern India .
 Really she is happy to help
 Micro SIM stock was not available .
 Wrong bill miss commitment
 Excellent service .....keep it up.. .
 Given Quick resolution
 It seems Ur people are not having Good training ,they do not have proper information , Sr . People attitude is very casual ..
 Its ok but.my vodafone bill not correct.that next bill proberly clearing to send .
 They never told to sit any of the customers .. Just they enquired when the customers standging .. Except these things all other service in store is good ..
 Verry well @very good keep itup
 No assistance in Store . Talk like a parrot means nothing like a customer service . Visited twice in a day unnessarry . Pathetic Service
 VERY GOOD
 any problems always I get best service
 Your vodafone service is best
 Being long time customer and like other service providers Sim replacement should be at FOC.
 Service is a word of extraordinary pleasure satisfaction and enormous happiness Wen customers get absolute hold of all ur products for their perusal .. People in red are so passionate aligned and disciplined under the Vodafone roof specific to locality culture and ethics .. No doubt Vodafone uses all these ladders to climb to unmatchable heights
 Customer service is fantastic
 I got my job done in no time
 I had a good experience . Thanks .
 Didnt like hw Deepa was uncooperative . Rahul was slightly better .
 The waiting time was more than 30 minutes and my problem was not resolved .
 Your staff appeared disinterested to assist .

 I was welcomed nicely and the reasons for which I went there were trully satisfying for me.. .
 My problem was taken care of very quickly and at no cost .
 I had converted from prepaid to postpaid.i had taken a rental plan of 225 and 1 GB 3G data plan and I recd bill of 2341 due to non activation of data plan .on asking them why they did not activate my plan they spoke with me rudely and said that with whom u had taken the plan has left the job.if Vodafone associate leaves the job or whatever the reason might be should I be the sufferrer.their behaviour was very bad and rude as if I have done a crime from con
 UR Rep was unable clarify abt ECS enabling
 Not interested in serving customers.just want to get rid of us asap
 agent was very helpful & way of talking was very politely I was Abt to port out from the network but he info the plan which I think will work for me
 I lost my previous no 9966998257 because of you guys and they gave me the new 9966999207 with postpaid connection for changing it into prepaidconnectionI get in for plenty of times in vodafone store it is a **** of vodafane store I never seen it in any store after getting the prepaid I will change to tata docmo along with my friends and family members
 Good
 Very good
 My request was not taken care of yet . The supervisor of the agent who talked to me committed that he will call me the very next day with a good resolution of my problem, but i didn't get any response yet . Also the cashier at the bill desk at that time - 19-Dec-2014 evening after 5 pm, lied to me that heis not having change for the bill amount that i need to pay even there were sufficient cash available at that time . So I was asked to pay more than thebilled amount . Anyway the store visit was total wastage of my time, effort and money .
 POTA
 loyees are so good
 Too long waiting periods
 Very bad i am going to change the network
 Quick resolution in the store whenever i visit ...good experience keep it up. .
 ganization
 I like that performance
 I was really pleased by the way the associate addressed me. . and he quickly resolved my issue .
 I visited the main store to upgrade my SIM card to 3G. This was my first visit and I was impressed with the efficiency of the representative I met: Smitha . In almost no time the purpose of my visit was achieved .
 My enquiries resolved within the said timeframe .
 Internet package was over
 We have a corporate account and need to be able to talk to some real person .
 My concern on a whopping bill of Rs 4000 odd for Internet usage was just brushed aside saying that the itemised bill reflects usage and nothing can be done about it For someone who has been with you for close to a decade right from the time you were another company and who has never had a bill of average1000 -1500 and usage around 2 GB was seeking an I depth review in the matter and filing a request for the same which was very casually handled till another presumably senior person was approached who was slightly better in responding Request that my concerns on this front be addressed properly given my loto and excess billed reversed
 Pleasing n very helpful n bright glowing facial expressions n fast in her work
 Excellent
 Everything was great
 really like the way of customer care . So rated on high score . Last time I did not reply this . Thanks .
 My problem was not resolved . The hotline csr asked me to visit the store to resolve issue . The store mentioned they will send a person home to do the same . I asked for quick and urgent resolution as I am loosing work time, but nobody turned up during the day yesterday . My other issue faced with gprs settings was resolved quickly .
 Realy i Would like to appreciate the executive how he handled my problem and sloved it .
 Service and care taking was good
 I had visited Vodafone store to change address and submitted req proofs but till now it didn't change. . Now I visited second tiime they told me it wouldtake seven days to change and they took new req also . Not sure after 7 days it would change or not . Please train ur executives properly. .
 n the seat . So there were lots of idle time for which customer has to suffer . These need to be rectified .
 A friendly n homely atmosphere
 Very helpful
 hout losing temper thanks
 Ur network service is good but Unfair deduction...net pack charge is high for given data use...please lookin to tis matter . otherwise thumps up for vodafone .
 Attitude of the exe is gud . Had helping mentality etc. .
 Store associate able to address my issue effectively and communicated the information which I needed
 Waiting time, phone instrument being passed on from one counter to another & returned without a word of whether problem solved or not .
 Staff attended me was . Very helping and cheerful . Problem identified quickly .solution to problem wasgiven reasonably late . Appreciated enjoyed very . Well
 Very helpfull.patient in listening and giving explaination
 Your service is quite good but your representative was not cooperative
 All good

 sed on company's technology . Hidden charges are levied and cannot provide the customer's request of that specific usage .
 Chor company hai . Sb sallle chor hai
 to call next person in line management is very poor
 Understood the problem n gud behavior n resolved it
 Satisfied
 Store executives were customer friendly.Provided details which were asked with good explanation .
 I had to argue for a facility which is on my cost .
 I visited the store and was treated very well by customer associate..Vodafone rocks....!!! ! Zooozooooo

 The executive answered all our questions . The migration to micro sim is seamless . I am very happy with service

 Excellent
 Its better response.... . :)
 to resolve my problem kindly help
 Your survice persons are fantastic . But your system is poor
 Delighted experience with easy go process :) n well done
 She wanted me to come back with it and wait in queue again to be serviced . I had to persuade her to take it as while I was waiting for half an hour to battended to, I had already inquired at the enquiry counter if document copies would b taken in the store . Also the staff doesn't have consistent informaacceptable to them as an address proof . They wanted me to get the original . They weren't sensitive to the fact that tenants never get the originals . No other solution was even attempted . The entire interaction just seemed to give me a feeling that they were looking for reasons for the customer to leave the store .
 Talk later ?
 Some store associates in purple t shirt r rude to us they feel that they r the person who knows all about Vodafone
 I had to wait 1 hr for the service . There was a heated argument among other customers about the same and this is not a stray scenario .
 No proper guidance in name transferring of subscriber
 ing simple cards for others before and after me I don't know why I was asked to go in que for payment Counter to get a sim for me is that what vodafone Ito resolve my issue and be in que again so that was rude because I wanted to do simple swap my token no was 128 I saw same counter and same rep distributExperience was worst people not helpfull and had no system knowledge took long time to resolve issues it's not just queries I had its in general reviews
 Vodafone has treated me as a premium customer
 to provide solution . For activating nano sim it's taking maximum four days .
 Gud
 Really bad service that's the reason of me moving to Airtel and closing this connection
 The Vodafone rep helped me in "Changing The Plan" which will reduce my monthly RENT he also asvised me to visit him during Ist week of Jan 2015 to effectys of Recharging can be done in Prepaid than in Post paid .
 All staff are very helpful . I got help from them .
 I have take 4 sim cards . One of them is 9819154364. They r not getting activated since 2 weeks . Mr Anand at ur thane center says that he is not responsible for the card . Customer care doesn't responses either . Going to change the operator immediately .
 My new sim did not start as the moron in your store did not the input the details correctly
 I visited to newly opened store the ambiance and staff were good but need to expedite the response

 Satisfactory service
 Vodafone helpers have not much knowledge wht is asked by customer they asked some other person or they have to checked nd after that also they nt give proper satisfaction to the customer .
 e a mere walk in customer
 Until 3g is not activate
 call center representatives only gave excuses that bill is right . Store can have some automated ticketing system, other than that store is fine .
 on my voter card printed my address wrong . I was asked to personally visit the store with new id or else my no will not be activated . I cancelled it andI was charged for a no 9953698107, a new connection that never got activated to my knowledge . I was told my address was wrong and true a clerical mistake
 Highly unsatisfactory responses
 Quck service
 Keep better executives wth complete knowledge and the waiting period is too much for a small query to be resolved
 t it didn't and I had to visit again when there was a lot of crowd . That's the only problem I faced other than that the experience was very nice .
 First of all m not happy with ur service that u r gibing to ur customer and my last month bill was generated wrong.In any rear case i could not see my bill then this will come everymonth wrongly taht would become hectic for me in future.Is this the way you giving a servide to ur customer .

 Actually in mizoram its very hard to understand english and hindi but that store associate she understand us and help everything the documents and all asI am from other state and the say she explains about vodafone was good enough thats all

 Unsatisfied with vodafone services towards customer . Wat u care is only money .
 The staff was very helpful and friendly ..they were really "happy to help"
 Your executive was too good .
 Like you service
 were handled satisfactorily
 not able to.provide 3G speeds even in Metros like bangalore, i use airtel in other phone which is prepaid and i can see a very huge difference in the speed and usage . I am actually planning for a number portability if this is going to continue.Besides this i neither get my bill to the address i gave nor to the email i registered .

 Store people are not helping, they got weird attitude to towards clients
 Went to change micro sim to nano sim . Waiting time was about half hour , which is excessive . There was no one to guide us when we entered . Once we got toHelpdesk the lady was efficient and good .
 I felt so happy for ur service with ur executive .

 My query was resolved satisfactorily and quickly by Mr.Suhas . But I don't know when the changes will be implemented in my prepaid plans .
 Last month I gave request for address change and with address change my name is also changed . As a result I am not able to claim mobile reimbursement fro
 days to return that amount .. . Totally frustrated with service of Vodafone . I never expect this kind of service from Vodafone .

 It took me 2 hours of waiting at your outlet just to get a nano sim card .....in this era of self certification u insist on a rubber stamp.....laughable...... .
 The Store Associate Sumayya was very patient and understanding and great help with all my queries .
 I had visited twice to ur store still the reversal to my no for the service which i requested to deactivate was actually been charging into my account &I trusting Vodafone i had been paying same . Your customer service is very poor especially TTK Road Branch . No responsible person to question / help clients .
 Till continue this tipe your service thanks

 It's average . Please improve your customer care service.Customers should have access to your executives .
 Excellent response and timely deliverance
 How time so bor yar
 The store associate didn't know the solution to my problem, for which he had to consult another associate, and because he was busy i had to wait for another 15 mins . On the other hand even though 2-3 store associates were standing free they were attending customers according to their own mood, due to which the line was moving pretty slow .
 Happy to help ; immediate response .thanks Vodafone

 5th December 2014 I visited customers care centre & Mr.Wasim was there I request to him plz deactivate my net 2G plan & active 3G plan but till date 3G plan not active . Unnecessary charg me net charges
 No comment
 Waited for almost 45 mins just to get a Nano sim card .
 Work as per commitment So customer can not wast time .
 That guy is very rude
 Hi. . All ur executive started to pass comments among themselves as I entered.. . Then they wanted a copy of my ID.. For which their printer din work. . I asked if their office boy could go get a copy of my PAN. . He is like ** won't go. . And was its here only u can go get it and come. . Am I ur customer or doservice I have never come across. .
 Good customer service
 You switched of my card after I did not used it for somwdays ! That's is not very nice, especially as a tourist !
 My query was resolved in appropriate time
 Satisfactory experience
 Response was not prompt
 Q1 - there are lot of drop calls happening nowadays and consequently the bills rise . Again data charges should be same across all schemes and ideally should be charged as per usage without any fixed rentals for the same . Q2 - the store has an excellent ambience . Q3 - the staff was not only courteous butalso knowledgeable .
 Overall my is good with ur staff but whenever we asked them why my cell is showing Alibaug or Goa roaming at my current Resi then they enable to answer
 Vodafone networks is supparb mobile network
 Very prompt and helpful behaviour from the executive at the shop . I have been using Vodafone for many years now . But going to port due to range problem .
 I would like to have a better plan combo as in net and callingas I am a heavy usage person. . I am geting 4000 mins free and 5 gb 3g free in 1300 from idea .if u cn match da offer its beter or else wil be left with no option bt to port.also ur service has deteriorated
 Got wrong information from customer care . Even could not contact your customer care
 Service is prompt friendly n satisfactory
 I want my problem solved...pls release my another account num 9787225212
 Minimum half an hour wait before you get your turn because the staff is not at their desk . Even when serving the customer staff is half time talking to their colleagues rather than finish with the customer . - Mujahid Rupani

 Respond quickly and activate offers within time and call me i have complaint regording bal

 Very good but waiting is too long so attend customer as early as possible .
 Very satisfied

 Store was good but representatives were not listening, i said i need micro sim, they just replaced the same size sim . I had to reiterate my need . I saidi want to know my 3g data limit, my bill and sms is not helping me with that . They said sms bla-bla.. . to 111 .... .
 95% of the time, my queries were sorted out in less than 15 min .
 No one in ur office is ready to entertain the customer
 Very intaligent service
 Very helpfull staff .
 At the outset I express my sorrow for responding so late . I am a senior Citizen . It may not be possible for me to write as much as I want to say . If youso like, pl . give me contact no . of the manager of the Store enabling me to meet in person & explain when I go next time to Garia . In the meantime I request to depute COURTEOUS, KNOWLEDGEABLE & WILLING TO WORK persons for listening to the querries of customers . No one should treat a customer as disturbing element .
 1st of all a warm welcome by Mr Aditya, instantly alocated token number,ensured I WL b attended by ur staff.Moreover staff is very cooperative,Mr Jitendra attended my issue and further assured by giving his mob no fr issue if still need to b resolved .
 Work system is appreciable . Staff tries to satisfy customer .
 Pakka network
 The store associate just gave me general details about my problems which I already searched on the Internet . I wish if he could have pushed himself n tried helping me out in detail about the extra charge in my bill .
 Very good no complians
 Only 2 counters were operational out of 4 or 5 capacity . Waiting time 20-30 minutes .
 Nice
 Net work problems are not solved even after the repeated request . Ur staff are not able to handle my complaint
 Because of your executive I have visited twice at Vodafone store. . two months before I went to Vodafone store and I changed my plan bt it was not changed. . Bt this time they change it
 All team is help full . But my issue is not yet resolved . Waiting for 24th dec .
 Pls call me after 5 pm today if you need details
 Fast response
 Cause store's working person are very cooperative.. .

 I have already sent u a mail
 They need to be customer friendly and helpful . They need to be trained to understand needs and follow instructions
 be happy to visit Tnagar very often and ask my friends also to visit Tnagar Store . Thank u for ur efforts in collecting feedback from customers .
 Was good response
 Your's company net service is zero
 Your response and helping services deserves all these ratings . Thanks for your cooperation .
 excellent
 What logic is this ? Would appreciate if you wud improve ur service standards since it's becoming pathetic by the day .
 Priya awasthi's services are the best
 Interaction is satisfactory which is the reason for my ratings.. .
 Need to increase counters as people wait for half n hour for just a sim exchange or inquiry
 and courteous .
 I was looked after by priyanka and puneet to satisfy me to my various querie they went beyond answering my queries and satisfied me I appreciate there help . Whertevet shorts coming I found are in the Vodafone and train systems .
 We want to close this service because I can nt bear the amount of bill thatset
 Network is disturbing/not available everywhere . Moreover, voice quality is poor sometime as well as call failure .
 Mainly about the service offered and quickly
 No.1 store is very update reason for 7 no.2asperas satisfaction for me it 50/50 no.3 interaction your executive is change my plan to go with yours plan
 Excellent Service

 It was a good expirience . behaviour was good They had solve my pr
 The service was quick  Dhiraj & Jai were eager to help & solve issues  However some staff portrayed lack of professionalism
 My simcard is blockd . And your manager harsh is said Me your sim card is started 10 minit but he was not startin for 24 hours .
 They don't listen, they busy in their talk .
 I like Vodafone service.. . But u should decrease the 3g rates . Overall its good. . :-)
 We are fed up disservice, lies and deceit by Vodafone so we are porting out and there is no end to harassment we don't want to talk to Vidafone any moreand no more surveys when you have no regard for customers
 The reasons for which I have given 10 points earlier .
 Vodafone Store took almost 2 Hrs to solve my quary ..
 Very poor communication skills
 fficult to get work done at Vodafone store
 My out going msg is barred . This is a big problem for me . But vodafone store solve this problem and make good behave for me .
 I havnt got prompt service via customer care.. . That's the reason i walked into a store.. . Still my problem is not resolved.. .
 Excepting your manager the guy with specs the rest if them had no clue about how to handle the problem . Ashish was OK. The rest of them kept explainingirrelevant details . You can definite ly do better
 I dont received any solution from 15th date of December
 Best services
 I wasn't happy with the way the issue was handled . I just wanted my SIM card to be replaced as at times people are not able to contact me (I've confirmedit is not a handset/network problem) . Firstly they didn't tell me that a replacement SIM is chargeable, I had to ask, nothing was done proactively except a sales pitch for some offer , considering the tenure with you as a customer I feel the charges should be waved off . Secondly I had to wait a long timenot only to get to the support staff but also while he was attending to me, there were no seats and the AC wasn't working (senior citizens were also madeto stand) . Thirdly the point which really got me annoyed was when the support staff told me that that my signature did not match . I gave him both versions of my signature but he said that it did not match so no SIM can be given . I left the store irate, was contemplating canceling the account but decidedto try again . I called your contact center and after confirming the security details I was told that I will receive the replacement SIM in 24 hrs !! ! Nowthat's the type of service I appreciate !! ! So why the unnecessary harassment at the store ? Also I would like to know how the signature did not match ? Is the some manipulation done by someone in your backoffice ? I've been with this network from the time it was called Orange but such issues make me thinkof moving to another network .
 This time load was low in workshop hence executives Attended well though not much happy with washing of car . Ac wents not dedusted . ***** hand prints wrre on door . Foot mats not dried . Paper not spread on footmats
 Having problem with my bill plz solve it as soon as posible
 In order to get a better plan as i have brought my mother into using vodaphone as a new subscriber she is eligible for your red plans but if we choose afamily plan as we are a family i lose all my privilages of being a loyal customer of so many years and have to take a new number . What sense does this make ? Do you as a company not value customer loyalty and shouldn' t families be allowed to be on a family plan ?
 24 atm billing payment , quickly resolve all the problem ,
 GOOD BEHAVIOUR & HELPFUL INFORMATION GIVEN TO CUSTOMER BENEFITS

 Beause my sim was activated with in 2 hr of my vodafone store visit but i did not recive my previour balance which was around 100 rs

 The associate at the store was courteous and solved my problem asap .
 Upgraded sim but service did not start after 2 hours had to do repeated follow up at the service centre
 GOOD
 There is no proper sitting arrangements . Peoples have to wait at least 1 and half hour for their queries . Many peoples are attended without having to wait after taking token as they know the person sitting there from some reference .
 Staff behave very rough. .
 For improvement of customer services
 No sense of responsibility . No courtesy towards customer . No respect towards customer .
 The person (Johnson Geek) was polite, pleasant and ready to explain/ answer my questions in great detail . This is what we customers expect when we walk into your store . Professionalism ! Thank you .

 See ,i am using vodafone for last many years. . But nowdays network issues disappoint me..and finally you prove me wrong about your services and too. .
 Advice & suggestions given to me have been good & reasonable . Service had been prompt & the personal touch impressed me most .
 th vodafone this is the first one I am facing and if vodafone does not resolve this, I will change the carrier
 Waiting time is not too much and your employee solved my issue
 Fast excellent service by store associate .I'm not satisfied with my over all call rates and plan bit costly compare to other network providers .
 Am the old customer for Vodafone every time visit to store there is no special offers or tariff to us.am the post paid customer now days bill is going costly i didn't get any solution to reduce my bill .
 I got my token at 2.22pm . I was finally called at 3.34 pm .
